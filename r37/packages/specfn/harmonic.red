% Solid Harmonics of order n (Laplace polynomials)
% are homogeneous polynomials of degree n in x,y,z
% which are solutions of Laplace equation:-

% 	df(P,x,2) + df(P,y,2) + df(P,z,2) = 0.

% There are 2*n+1 independent such polynomials for any given n >=0
% and with:-

%	w!0 = z, w!+ = i*(x-i*y)/2, w!- = i*(x+i*y)/2,

% they are given by the Fourier integral:-

% S(n,m,w!-,w!0,w!+) = 

%	(1/(2*pi)) * 
%       for u:=-pi:pi integrate (w!0 + w!+ * exp(i*u) + w!- *
%           exp(-i*u))^n * exp(i*m*u) * du;

% which is obviously zero if |m| > n since then all terms in the
% expanded integrand contain the factor exp(i*k*u) with k neq 0,

% S(n,m,x,y,z) is proportional to
%     r^n * Legendre(n,m,cos theta) * exp(i*phi)

% Let r2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 and r = sqrt(r2).

% The spherical harmonics are simply the restriction of the solid
% harmonics to the surface of the unit sphere and the set of all
% spherical harmonics {n >=0; -n <= m =< n} form a complete orthogonal
% basis on it, i.e. <n,m|n',m'> = Kronecker_delta(n,n') *
% Kronecker_delta(m,m') using <...|...> to designate the scalar product
% of functions over the spherical surface.

% The coefficients of the solid harmonics are normalised in what
% follows to yield an ortho-normal system of spherical harmonics.

% Given their polynomial nature, there are many recursions formulae 
% for the solid harmonics and any recursion valid for Legendre functions
% can be 'translated' into solid harmonics. However the direct proof is
% usually far simpler using Laplace's definition. 

% It is also clear that all differentiations of solid harmonics are 
% trivial, qua polynomials.

% Some substantial reduction in the symbolic form would occur if one
% maintained throughout the recursions the symbol r2 (r cannot occur
% as it is not rational in x,y,z). Formally the solid harmonics appear
% in this guise as more compact polynomials in (x,y,z,r2).

% Only two recursions are needed:-

% (i) along the diagonal (n,n);

% (ii) along a line of constant n: (m,m),(m+1,m),...,(n,m).

% Numerically these recursions are stable.

% For m < 0 one has:-

%	S(n,m,x,y,z) = (-1)^m * S(n,-m,x,-y,z);
