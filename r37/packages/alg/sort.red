symbolic procedure sort(l,pred);
   % Sort the list l according to the given predicate.  If l is a list
   % of numbers then the predicate "lessp" will sort the list into
   % ascending order.  The predicate should be a strict inequality,
   % i.e. it should return NIL if the two items compared are equal.  As
   % implemented here SORT just calls STABLE-SORT, but as a matter of
   % style any use where the ordering of incomparable items in the
   % output matters ought to use STABLE!-SORT directly, thereby
   % allowing the replacement of this code with a faster non-stable
   % method. (Note: the previous REDUCE sort function also happened to
   % be stable, so this code should give exactly the same results for
   % all calls where the predicate is self-consistent and never has
   % both pred(a,b) and pred(b,a) true).
   stable!-sortip(append(l, nil), pred);

symbolic procedure stable!-sort(l,pred);
   % Sorts a list, as SORT, but if two items x and y in the input list
   % satisfy neither pred(x,y) nor pred(y,x) [i.e. they are equal so far
   % as the given ordering predicate is concerned] this function
   % guarantees that they will appear in the output list in the same
   % order that they were in the input.
   stable!-sortip(append(l, nil), pred);

symbolic procedure stable!-sortip(l, pred);
   % As stable!-sort, but over-writes the input list to make the output.
   % It is not intended that people should call this function directly:
   % it is present just as the implementation of the main sort
   % procedures defined above.

      l1 := l;

      if null l2 then return l;   % Input list of length 1
      % Now I have dealt with the essential special cases of lists of
      % length 0 and 1 (which do not need sorting at all).  Since it
      % possibly speeds things up just a little I will now have some
      % fairly ugly code that makes special cases of lists of length 2.
      % I could easily have special code for length 3 lists here (and
      % include it, but commented out), but at present my measurements
      % suggest that the speed improvement that it gives is minimal and
      % the increase in code bulk is large enough to give some pain.

      % Now I will check to see if the list is in fact in order already
      % Doing so will have a cost - but sometimes that cost will be
      % repaid when I am able to exit especially early.  The result of
      % all this is that I will have a best case behaviour with linear
      % cost growth for inputs that are initially in the correct order,
      % while my average and worst-case costs will increase by a
      % constant factor.
      l := l1;
      % In the input list is NOT already in order then I expect that
      % this loop will exit fairly early, and so will not contribute
      % much to the total cost.  If it exits very late then probably in
      % the next recursion down the first half of the list will be
      % found to be already sorted, and again I have a chance to win.
