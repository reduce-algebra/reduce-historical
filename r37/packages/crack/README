This directory contains a suite of four packages: crack, applysym,
liepde and conlaw.  The last three all call crack, which is
essentially a library of routines, and hence automatically load crack.
Beware that the liepde and conlaw test files take quite a lot of
computing resource.

Note that Thomas Wolf used PSL-REDUCE 3.6 when writing his code, and I
have ported it to CSL where necessary.  I have tested the suite using
both CSL and PSL (under Windows 95).  The distributed log files were
run using CSL, but PSL produces equivalent results.  Also, there is
currently no crack.tst file, but crack is indirectly tested by the
other three test files.
