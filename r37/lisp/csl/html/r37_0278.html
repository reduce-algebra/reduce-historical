<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>demo</em> switch is used for interactive files, causing the system to
  pause after each command in the file until you type a <em>Return</em>. Default
  is <em>off</em>.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The switch <em>demo</em> has no effect on top level interactive statements.
  Use it when you want to slow down operations in a file so you can see what is
  happening.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  You can either include the <em>on demo</em> command in the file, or enter it
  from the top level before bringing in any file. Unlike the

  <a href="r37_0128.html">pause</a> command, <em>on demo</em> does not permit
  you to interrupt the file for questions of your own.
