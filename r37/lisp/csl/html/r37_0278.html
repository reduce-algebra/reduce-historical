<P>
The <em>demo</em> switch is used for interactive files, causing the system 
to pause after each command in the file until you type a <em>Return</em>. 
Default is <em>off</em>. 
<P>
<P>
The switch <em>demo</em> has no effect on top level interactive 
statements. Use it when you want to slow down operations in a file so 
you can see what is happening. 
<P>
<P>
You can either include the <em>on demo</em> command in the file, or enter 
it from the top level before bringing in any file. Unlike the 

<A HREF=r37_0128.html>pause</A> command, <em>on demo</em> does not permit you to
 interrupt 
the file for questions of your own.
