<p>
  The <em>precedence</em> declaration attaches a precedence to an infix
  operator.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>precedence</em>&lt;operator&gt;,&lt;known\_operator&gt;</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;operator&gt; should have been declared an operator but may be a REDUCE
  identifier that is not already an operator, array, or matrix.
  &lt;known\_operator&gt; must be a system infix operator or have had its
  precedence already declared.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>examples:</h3>
<p></p>
<pre><TT>
operator f,h; 

precedence f,+; 

precedence h,*; 

a + f(1,2)*c; 

  (1 F 2)*C + A 


a + h(1,2)*c; 

  1 H 2*C + A 


a*1 f 2*c; 

  A F 2*C 


a*1 h 2*c; 

  1 H 2*A*C

</TT></PRE>
<p>
  The operator whose precedence is being declared is inserted into t he infix
  operator precedence list at the next higher place than
  &lt;known\_operator&gt;.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Attaching a precedence to an operator has the side effect of declaring the
  operator to be infix. If the identifier argument for <em>precedence</em> has
  not been declared to be an operator, an attempt to use it causes an error
  message. After declaring it to be an operator, it becomes an infix operator
  with the precedence previously given. Infix operators may be used in prefix
  form; if they are used in infix form, a space must be left on each side of the
  operator to avoid ambiguity. Declared infix operators are always binary.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  To see the infix operator precedence list, enter symbolic mode and type
  <em>preclis!*;</em>. The lowest precedence operator is listed first.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>All prefix operators have precedence higher than infix operators.</p>
