When the <em>precise</em> switch is on, simplification of roots of even 
powers returns absolute values, a more precise answer mathematically. 
Default is <em>on</em>.

</TT></PRE><P>In many types of mathematical work, simplification of powers and s
urds can 
proceed by the fastest means of simplifying the exponents arithmetically. 
When it is important to you that the positive root be returned, turn 
<em>precise</em> on. One situation where this is important is when graphing 
square-root expressions such as sqrt(x^2+y^2) to 
avoid a spike caused by REDUCE simplifying 
sqrt(y^2) to y when x is 
zero.
