SCOPE is a package for the production of an optimized form of a set of 
expressions. It applies an heuristic search for common (sub)expressions 
to almost any set of proper REDUCE assignment statements. The output is 
obtained as a sequence of assignment statements. <em>gentran</em> is used to 
facilitate expression output.
