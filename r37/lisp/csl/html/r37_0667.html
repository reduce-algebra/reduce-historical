  SCOPE is a package for the production of an optimized form of a set of
  expressions. It applies an heuristic search for common (sub)expressions to
  almost any set of proper REDUCE assignment statements. The output is obtained
  as a sequence of assignment statements. <em>gentran</em> is used to facilitate
  expression output.
