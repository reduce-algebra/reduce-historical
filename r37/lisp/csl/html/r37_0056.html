<P>
The 
<A HREF=r37_0056.html>repeat</A> command causes repeated execution of a statemen
t 
 <em>until</em><P>
<P>
the given condition is found to be true. The statement is always executed 
at least once. 
 <P> <H3> 
syntax: </H3>
<P>
<P>
<em>repeat</em>&lt;statement&gt; <em>until</em> &lt;condition&gt; 
<P>
<P>
<P>
&lt;statement&gt; can be a single statement, 
<A HREF=r37_0038.html>group</A> statement, or 
a <em>begin</em>...<em>end</em> 
<A HREF=r37_0041.html>block</A>. &lt;condition&gt; must be 
a logical operator that evaluates to true or nil.

&lt;&lt;m := 4; repeat &lt;&lt;write 100*x*m;m := m-1&gt;&gt; until m = 0&gt;

&lt;&lt;m := -1; repeat &lt;&lt;write m; m := m-1&gt;&gt; until m &lt;= 0&gt;
&gt;;
			 


  -1

</TT></PRE><P><em>repeat</em>must always be followed by an <em>until</em> with a
 condition. 
Be careful not to generate an infinite loop with a condition that is never 
true. In the second example, if the condition had been <em>m = 0</em>, it 
would never have been true since <em>m</em> already had value -2 when the 
condition was first evaluated.
