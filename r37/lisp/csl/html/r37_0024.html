<p>
  The <em>:=</em> is the assignment operator, assigning the value on the
  right-han d side to the identifier or other valid expression on the left-hand
  side.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
&lt;restricted\_expression&gt; <em>:=</em> &lt;expression&gt;
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;restricted\_expression&gt; is ordinarily a single identifier, though
  simple expressions may be used (see Comments below). &lt;expression&gt; is any
  valid REDUCE expression. If &lt;expression&gt; is a
  <a href="r37_0345.html">matrix</a>
  identifier, then &lt;restricted\_expression&gt; can be a matrix identifier
  (redimensioned if necessary) which has each element set to the corresponding
  elements of the identifier on the right-hand side.

w + (c := x + 3) + z;

  W + X + Z + 3

  X + 3


y + b := c;

  Y + B := C


y;

  - (B - C)

<p>
  The assignment operator is right associative, as shown in the seco nd and
  third examples. A string of such assignments has all but the last item set to
  the value of the last item. Embedding an assignment statement in another
  expression has the side effect of making the assignment, as well as causing
  the given replacement in the expression.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Assignments of values to expressions rather than simple identifiers (such as
  in the last example above) can also be done, subject to the following remarks:
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  _ _ _ (i) If the left-hand side is an identifier, an operator, or a power, the
  substitution rule is added to the rule table.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  _ _ _ (ii) If the operators <em>- + /</em> appear on the left-hand side, all
  but the first term of the expression is moved to the right-hand side.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  _ _ _ (iii) If the operator <em>*</em> appears on the left-hand side, any
  constant terms are moved to the right-hand side, but the symbolic factors
  remain.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Assignment is valid for
  <a href="r37_0188.html">array</a> elements, but not for entire arrays. The
  assignment operator can also be used to attach functionality to operators.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  A recursive construction such as <em>a := a + b</em> is allowed, but when
  <em>a</em> is referenced again, the process of resubstitution continues until
  the expression stack overflows (you get an error message). Recursive
  assignments can be done safely inside controlled loop expressions, such as
  <a href="r37_0047.html">for</a>... or
  <a href="r37_0056.html">repeat</a>...<em>until</em>.
