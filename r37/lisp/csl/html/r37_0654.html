  Involutive bases are a new tool for solving problems in connection with
  multivariate polynomials, such as solving systems of polynomial equations and
  analyzing polynomial ideals. An involutive basis of polynomial ideal is
  nothing but a special form of a redundant Groebner basis. The construction of
  involutive bases reduces the problem of solving polynomial systems to simple
  linear algebra.
