Involutive bases are a new tool for solving problems in connection with 
multivariate polynomials, such as solving systems of polynomial equations 
and analyzing polynomial ideals. An involutive basis of polynomial ideal 
is nothing but a special form of a redundant Groebner basis. The 
construction of involutive bases reduces the problem of solving polynomial 
systems to simple linear algebra.
