<p></p>
<p>
  An operator can be declared linear in its first argument over powers of its
  second argument by the declaration <em>linear.</em>
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>linear</em>&lt;operator&gt;{<em>,</em>&lt;operator&gt;}*</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;operator&gt; must have been declared to be an operator. Be careful not to
  use a system operator name, because this command may change its definition.
  The operator being declared must have at least two arguments, and the second
  one must be a
  <a href="r37_0002.html">kernel</a>.

<p>
  Even when the operator has not had its functionality attached, it exhibits
  linear properties as shown in the examples. Notice the difference when
  dependencies are added. Dependencies are also in effect when the operator's
  first argument contains its second, as in the last line above.

  article in the &lt;Journal of Computational Physics&gt;, Vol. 14 (1974), pp.
  301-317, ``Analytic Computation of Some Integrals in Fourth Order Quantum
  Electrodynamics,&quot; by J.A. Fox and A.C. Hearn. The article includes the
  complete listing of REDUCE procedures used for this work.
