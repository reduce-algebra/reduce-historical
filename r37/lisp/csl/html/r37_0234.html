<p></p>
<p>The <em>shut</em> command closes output files.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>shut</em>&lt;filename&gt;{,&lt;filename&gt;}*</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;filename&gt; must have been a file opened by
  <a href="r37_0233.html">out</a>.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  A file that has been opened by
  <a href="r37_0233.html">out</a> must be <em>shut</em> before it is brought in
  by <a href="r37_0231.html">in</a>. Files that have been opened by
  <em>out</em> should always be <em>shut</em> before the end of the REDUCE
  session, to avoid either loss of information or the printing of extraneous
  information into the file. In most systems, terminating a session by
  <a href="r37_0124.html">bye</a> closes all open output files.
