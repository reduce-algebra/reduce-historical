The <em>shut</em> command closes output files.

syntax: </H3>

<em>shut</em>&lt;filename&gt;{,&lt;filename&gt;}*

&lt;filename&gt; must have been a file opened by

<P>
<P>
A file that has been opened by 
<A HREF=r37_0233.html>out</A> must be <em>shut</em> before it is 
brought in by 
<A HREF=r37_0231.html>in</A>. Files that have been opened by <em>out</em> should
 
always be <em>shut</em> before the end of the REDUCE session, to avoid either 
loss of information or the printing of extraneous information into the file. 
In most systems, terminating a session by 
<A HREF=r37_0124.html>bye</A> closes all open 
output files.
