constraints.

</TT></PRE><P>Weights and 
<A HREF=r37_0229.html>wtlevel</A> are used for asymptotic constraints, where 
higher-order terms are considered insignificant. 
<P>
<P>
Weights are originally equivalent to 0 until set by a <em>weight</em> 
command. To remove a weight from a kernel, use the 
<A HREF=r37_0189.html>clear</A> 
command. Weights once assigned cannot be changed without clearing the 
identifier. Once a weight is assigned to a kernel, it is no longer a 
kernel and cannot be used in any REDUCE commands or operators that require 
kernels, until the weight is cleared. Note that terms are ordered by 
greatest weight. 
<P>
<P>
The weight level of the system is set by 
<A HREF=r37_0229.html>wtlevel</A>, initially at 
2. Since no kernels have weights, no effect from <em>wtlevel</em> can be 
seen. Once you assign weights to kernels, you must set <em>wtlevel</em> 
correctly for the desired operation. When weighted variables appear in a 
term, their weights are summed for the total weight of the term (powers of 
variables multiply their weights). When a term exceeds the weight level 
of the system, it is discarded from the result expression.
