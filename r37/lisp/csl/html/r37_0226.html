<p><b>WEIGHT</b> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ <b>command</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>weight</em> command is used to attach weights to kernels for
  asymptotic constraints.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>weight</em>&lt;kernel&gt; <em>=</em>&lt;number&gt;</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;kernel&gt; must be a REDUCE
  <a href="r37_0002.html">kernel</a>, &lt;number&gt; must be a positive integer,
  not 0.
</p>

<p></p>

<h3>examples:</h3>
<p></p>
<pre><TT>
a := (x+y)**4; 

        4      3        2  2        3    4
  A := X  + 4*X *Y + 6*X *Y  + 4*X*Y  + Y  


weight x=2,y=3; 

wtlevel 8; 

a; 

   4
  X  


wtlevel 10; 

a; 

   2     2             2
  X *(6*Y  + 4*X*Y  + X ) 


int(x**2,x); 

  ***** X invalid as KERNEL

<p>
  Weights and <a href="r37_0229.html">wtlevel</a> are used for asymptotic
  constraints, where higher-order terms are considered insignificant.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Weights are originally equivalent to 0 until set by a <em>weight</em>
  command. To remove a weight from a kernel, use the
  <a href="r37_0189.html">clear</a>
  command. Weights once assigned cannot be changed without clearing the
  identifier. Once a weight is assigned to a kernel, it is no longer a kernel
  and cannot be used in any REDUCE commands or operators that require kernels,
  until the weight is cleared. Note that terms are ordered by greatest weight.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The weight level of the system is set by
  <a href="r37_0229.html">wtlevel</a>, initially at 2. Since no kernels have
  weights, no effect from <em>wtlevel</em> can be seen. Once you assign weights
  to kernels, you must set <em>wtlevel</em> correctly for the desired operation.
  When weighted variables appear in a term, their weights are summed for the
  total weight of the term (powers of variables multiply their weights). When a
  term exceeds the weight level of the system, it is discarded from the result
  expression.
