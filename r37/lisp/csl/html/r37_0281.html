The <em>echo</em> switch is normally off for top-level entry, and on when files 

are brought in. If <em>echo</em> is turned on at the top level, your input 
statements are echoed to the screen (thus appearing twice). Default 
<em>off</em> (but note default <em>on</em> for files). 
<P>
<P>
If you want to display certain portions of a file and not others, use the 
commands <em>off echo</em> and <em>on echo</em> inside the file. If you want 
no display of the file, use the input command 
<P>
<P>
	<em>in</em> filename<em>$</em> 
<P>
<P>
rather than using the semicolon delimiter. 
<P>
<P>
Be careful when you use commands within a file to generate another file. 
Since <em>echo</em> is on for files, the output file echoes input statements 
(unlike its behavior from the top level). You should explicitly turn off 
<em>echo</em> when writing output, and turn it back on when you're done.
