  When <em>nolnr</em> is on, the linear properties of the integration operator

  <a href="r37_0154.html">int</a> are suppressed if the integral cannot be found
  in closed terms.
</p>

<p>
  REDUCE uses the linear properties of integration to attempt to break down an
  integral into manageable pieces. If an integral cannot be found in closed
  terms, these pieces are returned. When the <em>nolnr</em> switch is off, as
  many of the pieces as possible are integrated. When it is on, if any piece
  fails, the rest of them remain unevaluated.
