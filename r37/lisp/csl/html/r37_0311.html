When <em>nolnr</em> is on, the linear properties of the integration operator 

<A HREF=r37_0154.html>int</A> are suppressed if the integral cannot be found in 
closed terms. 
<P>
<P>
REDUCE uses the linear properties of integration to attempt to break down 
an integral into manageable pieces. If an integral cannot be found in 
closed terms, these pieces are returned. When the <em>nolnr</em> switch is off, 

as many of the pieces as possible are integrated. When it is on, if any piece 
fails, the rest of them remain unevaluated.
