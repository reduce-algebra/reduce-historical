A curve can be give as a set of precomputed points (a polygon) 
in 2 or 3 dimensions. Such a point set is a 
<A HREF=r37_0053.html>list</A> 
of points, where each point is a 
<A HREF=r37_0053.html>list</A> 2 (or 3) 
numbers. These numbers are interpreted as <em>(x,y)</em> 
(or <em>x,y,z</em>) coordinates. All points of one set must have 
the same dimension.

s, 
but only on a logically orthogonal mesh: the surface is defined 
by a list of curves (in 3d) which must have a uniform length. 
GNUPLOT then will draw an orthogonal mesh by first drawing the 
given lines, and second connecting the 1st point of the 1st curve 
with the 1st point of the 2nd curve, that one with the 1st point 
of the 3rd curve and so on for all curves and for all indexes.
