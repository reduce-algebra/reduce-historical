  A curve can be give as a set of precomputed points (a polygon) in 2 or 3
  dimensions. Such a point set is a
  <a href="r37_0053.html">list</a>
  of points, where each point is a
  <a href="r37_0053.html">list</a> 2 (or 3) numbers. These numbers are
  interpreted as <em>(x,y)</em> (or <em>x,y,z</em>) coordinates. All points of
  one set must have the same dimension.

  Also a surface in 3d can be given by precomputed point s, but only on a
  logically orthogonal mesh: the surface is defined by a list of curves (in 3d)
  which must have a uniform length. GNUPLOT then will draw an orthogonal mesh by
  first drawing the given lines, and second connecting the 1st point of the 1st
  curve with the 1st point of the 2nd curve, that one with the 1st point of the
  3rd curve and so on for all curves and for all indexes.
