  This package is a careful implementation of the Gosper and Zeilberger
  algorithms for indefinite and definite summation of hypergeometric terms,
  respectively. Extensions of these algorithms are also included that are valid
  for ratios of products of powers, factorials, gamma function terms, binomial
  coefficients, and shifted factorials that are rational-linear in their
  arguments.
