This package is a careful implementation of the Gosper and Zeilberger 
algorithms for indefinite and definite summation of hypergeometric terms, 
respectively. Extensions of these algorithms are also included that are 
valid for ratios of products of powers, 
factorials, gamma function 
terms, binomial coefficients, and shifted factorials that are 
rational-linear in their arguments.
