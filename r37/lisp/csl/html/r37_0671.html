This package implements formal Laurent series expansions in one variable 
using the domain mechanism of REDUCE. This means that power series 
objects can be added, multiplied, differentiated etc., like other first 
class objects in the system. A lazy evaluation scheme is used and thus 
terms of the series are not evaluated until they are required for printing 
or for use in calculating terms in other power series. The series are 
extendible giving the user the impression that the full infinite series is 
being manipulated. The errors that can sometimes occur using series that 
are truncated at some fixed depth (for example when a term in the required 
series depends on terms of an intermediate series beyond the truncation 
depth) are thus avoided.
