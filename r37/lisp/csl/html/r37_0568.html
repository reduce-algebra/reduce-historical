In general the interaction between REDUCE and GNUPLOT is performed 
as silently as possible. However, sometimes it might be useful 
to see the GNUPLOT commands generated by REDUCE, e.g. for a 
postprocessing of generated data sets independent of REDUCE. 
When the switch <em>trplot</em> is set on all GNUPLOT commands will 
be printed to the standard output additionally.
