  In general the interaction between REDUCE and GNUPLOT is performed as silently
  as possible. However, sometimes it might be useful to see the GNUPLOT commands
  generated by REDUCE, e.g. for a postprocessing of generated data sets
  independent of REDUCE. When the switch <em>trplot</em> is set on all GNUPLOT
  commands will be printed to the standard output additionally.
