The <em>in</em> command takes a list of file names and inputs each file into 
the system. 
 <P> <H3> 
syntax: </H3>
<P>
<P>
<em>in</em>&lt;filename&gt;{,&lt;filename&gt;}* 
<P>
<P>
<P>
&lt;filename&gt; must be in the current directory, or be a valid pathname. 
If the file name is not an identifier, double quote marks (<em>&quot;</em>) are 

needed around the file name. 
<P>
<P>
A message is given if the file cannot be found, or has a mistake 
in it. 
<P>
<P>
Ending the command with a semicolon causes the file to be echoed to the 
screen; ending it with a dollar sign does not echo the file. If you want 
some but not all of a file echoed, turn the switch 
<A HREF=r37_0281.html>echo</A> on or off 
in the file.

An efficient way to develop procedures in REDUCE is to write them into a file 
using a system editor of your choice, and then input the 
files into an active REDUCE session. REDUCE reparses the procedure as 
it takes information from the file, overwriting the previous procedure 
definition. When it accepts the procedure, it echoes its name to the screen. 
Data can also be input to the system from files. 
<P>
<P>
Files to be read in should always end in 
<A HREF=r37_0044.html>end</A><em>;</em> to avoid 
end-of-file problems. Note that this is an additional <em>end;</em> to any 
ending procedures in the file.
