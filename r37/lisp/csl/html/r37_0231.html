<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>in</em> command takes a list of file names and inputs each file into
  the system.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>in</em>&lt;filename&gt;{,&lt;filename&gt;}*</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;filename&gt; must be in the current directory, or be a valid pathname. If
  the file name is not an identifier, double quote marks (<em>&quot;</em>) are
  needed around the file name.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>A message is given if the file cannot be found, or has a mistake in it.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Ending the command with a semicolon causes the file to be echoed to the
  screen; ending it with a dollar sign does not echo the file. If you want some
  but not all of a file echoed, turn the switch
  <a href="r37_0281.html">echo</a> on or off in the file.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  An efficient way to develop procedures in REDUCE is to write them into a file
  using a system editor of your choice, and then input the files into an active
  REDUCE session. REDUCE reparses the procedure as it takes information from the
  file, overwriting the previous procedure definition. When it accepts the
  procedure, it echoes its name to the screen. Data can also be input to the
  system from files.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Files to be read in should always end in
  <a href="r37_0044.html">end</a><em>;</em> to avoid end-of-file problems. Note
  that this is an additional <em>end;</em> to any ending procedures in the file.
