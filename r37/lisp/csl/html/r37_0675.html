  <em>xideal</em>constructs Groebner bases for solving the left ideal membership
  problem: Groebner left ideal bases or GLIBs. For graded ideals, where each
  form is homogeneous in degree, the distinction between left and right ideals
  vanishes. Furthermore, if the generating forms are all homogeneous, then the
  Groebner bases for the non-graded and graded ideals are identical. In this
  case, <em>xideal</em> is able to save time by truncating the Groebner basis at
  some maximum degree if desired.
