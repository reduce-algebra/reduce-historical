<em>xideal</em>constructs Groebner bases for solving the left ideal 
membership problem: Groebner left ideal bases or GLIBs. For graded 
ideals, where each form is homogeneous in degree, the distinction between 
left and right ideals vanishes. Furthermore, if the generating forms are 
all homogeneous, then the Groebner bases for the non-graded and graded 
ideals are identical. In this case, <em>xideal</em> is able to save time by 
truncating the Groebner basis at some maximum degree if desired.
