If the expressions in a 
<A HREF=r37_0368.html>groebner</A> or 
<A HREF=r37_0390.html>groebnerf</A> 
call contain parameters (symbols 
which are not member of the variable list), the share variable 
<em>glterms</em> is set to a list of expression which during the 
calculation were assumed to be nonzero. The calculated bases 
are valid only under the assumption that all these expressions do 
not vanish.
