This short note describes a package of REDUCE procedures that allow 
Taylor expansion in one or more variables and efficient manipulation 
of the resulting Taylor series. Capabilities include basic operations 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and also 
application of certain algebraic and transcendental functions. To a 
certain extent, Laurent expansion can be performed as well.
