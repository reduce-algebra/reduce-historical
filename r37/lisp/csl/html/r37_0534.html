  This short note describes a package of REDUCE procedures that allow Taylor
  expansion in one or more variables and efficient manipulation of the resulting
  Taylor series. Capabilities include basic operations (addition, subtraction,
  multiplication and division) and also application of certain algebraic and
  transcendental functions. To a certain extent, Laurent expansion can be
  performed as well.
