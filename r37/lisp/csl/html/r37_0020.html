  The semicolon is a statement delimiter, indicating results are to be printed
  when used in interactive mode.

(x+1)**2;

  X  + 2*X + 1 


df(x**2 + 1,x); 

  2*X

<p>
  Entering a <em>Return</em> without a semicolon or dollar sign resu lts in a
  prompt on the following line. A semicolon or dollar sign can be added at this
  point to execute the statement. In interactive mode, a statement that is ended
  with a semicolon and <em>Return</em> has its results printed on the screen.
</p>

<p>
  Inside a group statement <em>&lt;&lt;</em>...<em>&gt;&gt;</em> or a
  <em>begin</em>...<em>end</em> block, a semicolon or dollar sign separates
  individual REDUCE statements. Since results are not printed from a block
  without a specific <em>return</em> statement, there is no difference between
  using the semicolon or dollar sign. In a group statement, the last value
  produced is the value returned by the group statement. Thus, if a semicolon or
  dollar sign is placed between the last statement and the ending brackets, the
  group statement returns the value 0 or nil, rather than the value of the last
  statement.
