</TT></PRE><P>Entering a <em>Return</em> without a semicolon or dollar sign resu
lts in a 
prompt on the following line. A semicolon or dollar sign can be 
added at this point to execute the statement. In interactive mode, a 
statement that is ended with a semicolon and <em>Return</em> has its results 
printed on the screen.

Inside a group statement <em>&lt;&lt;</em>...<em>&gt;&gt;</em> 
or a <em>begin</em>...<em>end</em> block, a 
semicolon or dollar sign separates individual REDUCE statements. Since 
results are not printed from a block without a specific <em>return</em> 
statement, there is no difference between using the semicolon or dollar 
sign. In a group statement, the last value produced is the value 
returned by the group statement. Thus, if a semicolon or dollar sign is 
placed between the last statement and the ending brackets, the group 
statement returns the value 0 or nil, rather than the value of the 
last statement.
