<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>algebraic</em> command changes REDUCE's mode of operation to
  algebraic. When <em>algebraic</em> is used as an operator (with an argument
  inside parentheses) that argument is evaluated in algebraic mode, but REDUCE's
  mode is not changed.

<pre><TT>
algebraic; 

symbolic; 

  NIL 


algebraic(x**2); 

   2
  X  


x**2; 

    ***** The symbol X has no value.

<p>
  REDUCE's symbolic mode does not know about most algebraic commands . Error
  messages in this mode may also depend on the particular Lisp used for the
  REDUCE implementation.
