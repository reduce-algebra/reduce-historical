The <em>algebraic</em> command changes REDUCE's mode of operation to 
algebraic. When <em>algebraic</em> is used as an operator (with an 
argument inside parentheses) that argument is evaluated in algebraic 
mode, but REDUCE's mode is not changed.

Error messages in this mode may also depend on the particular Lisp 
used for the REDUCE implementation.
