<P>
When the <em>errcont</em> switch is on, error conditions do not stop file 
execution. Error messages will be printed whether <em>errcont</em> is on or 
off. 
<P>
<P>
Default is <em>off</em>. 
<P>
<P>
The following describes what happens when an error occurs in a file under 
each setting of <em>errcont</em> and <em>int</em>: 
<P>
<P>
Both off: Message is printed and parsing continues, but no further 
statements are executed; no commands from keyboard accepted except bye or 
end; 
<P>
<P>
<em>errcont</em>off, <em>int</em> on: Message is printed, and you are asked 
if you wish to continue. (This is the default behavior); 
<P>
<P>
<em>errcont</em>on, <em>int</em> off: Message is printed, and file continues 
to execute without pause; 
<P>
<P>
Both on: Message is printed, and file continues to execute without pause.
