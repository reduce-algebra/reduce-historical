  Most operators of the <em>Groebner</em> package compute expressions in a
  polynomial ring which given as &lt;R&gt;[&lt;var&gt;,&lt;var&gt;,...] where
  &lt;R&gt; is the current REDUCE coefficient domain. All algebraically exact
  domains of REDUCE are supported. The package can operate over rings and
  fields. The operation mode is distinguished automatically. In general the ring
  mode is a bit faster than the field mode. The factoring variant can be applied
  only over domains which allow you factoring of multivariate polynomials.

  The variable sequence &lt;var&gt; is either declared explicitly as argument in
  form of a
  <a href="r37_0053.html">list</a> in <a href="r37_0354.html">torder</a>, or it
  is extracted automatically from the expressions. In the second case the
  current REDUCE system order is used (see <a href="r37_0198.html">korder</a>)
  for arranging the variables. If some kernels should play the role of formal
  parameters (the ground domain &lt;R&gt; then is the polynomial ring over
  these), the variable sequences must be given explicitly.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  All REDUCE
  <a href="r37_0002.html">kernel</a>s can be used as variables. But please note,
  that all variables are considered as independent. E.g. when using
  <em>sin(a)</em> and <em>cos(a)</em> as variables, the basic relation
  <em>sin(a)^2+cos(a)^2-1=0</em> must be explicitly added to an equation set
  because the Groebner operators don't include such knowledge automatically.

  The terms (monomials) in polynomials are arranged according to the current

  <a href="r37_0353.html">term order</a>. Note that the algebraic properties of
  the computed results only are valid as long as neither the ordering nor the
  variable sequence changes.

  The input expressions &lt;exp&gt; can be polynomials &lt;p&gt;, rational
  functions &lt;n&gt;/&lt;d&gt; or equations &lt;lh&gt;=&lt;rh&gt; built from
  polynomials or rational functions. Apart from the <em>tracing</em>
  algorithms
  <a href="r37_0397.html">groebnert</a> and
  <a href="r37_0398.html">preducet</a>, where the equations have a specific
  meaning, equations are converted to simple expressions by taking the
  difference of the left-hand and right-hand sides
  &lt;lh&gt;-&lt;rh&gt;=&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Rational functions are converted to
  polynomials by converting the expression to a common denominator form first,
  and then using the numerator only &lt;n&gt;=&gt;&lt;p&gt;. So eventual zeros
  of the denominators are ignored.
</p>

<p>
  A basis on input or output of an algorithm is coded as
  <a href="r37_0053.html">list</a> of expressions {&lt;exp&gt;,&lt;exp&gt;,...}
  .
