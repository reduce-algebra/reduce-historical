This package is an automatic code GENerator and TRANslator. It constructs 
complete numerical programs based on sets of algorithmic specifications and 
symbolic expressions. Formatted FORTRAN, RATFOR or C code can be generated 
through a series of interactive commands or under the control of a template 
processing routine. Large expressions can be automatically segmented into 
subexpressions of manageable size, and a special file-handling mechanism 
maintains stacks of open I/O channels to allow output to be sent to any 
number of files simultaneously and to facilitate recursive invocation of the 
whole code generation process.
