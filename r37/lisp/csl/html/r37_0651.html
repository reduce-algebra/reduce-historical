  This package is an automatic code GENerator and TRANslator. It constructs
  complete numerical programs based on sets of algorithmic specifications and
  symbolic expressions. Formatted FORTRAN, RATFOR or C code can be generated
  through a series of interactive commands or under the control of a template
  processing routine. Large expressions can be automatically segmented into
  subexpressions of manageable size, and a special file-handling mechanism
  maintains stacks of open I/O channels to allow output to be sent to any number
  of files simultaneously and to facilitate recursive invocation of the whole
  code generation process.
