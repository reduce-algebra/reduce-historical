<p>REDUCE knows <em>i</em> is the square root of -1, and that i^2 = -1.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>examples:</h3>
<p></p>
<pre><TT>
(a + b*i)*(c + d*i); 

  A*C + A*D*I + B*C*I - B*D 


i**2; 

  -1

</TT></PRE>
<p>
  <em>i</em>cannot be used as an identifier. It is all right to use
  <em>i</em>
  as an index variable in a <em>for</em> loop, or as a local (<em>scalar</em>)
  variable inside a <em>begin...end</em> block, but it loses its definition as
  the square root of -1 inside the block in that case.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Only the simplest properties of i are known by REDUCE unless the switch
  <a href="r37_0274.html">complex</a> is turned on, which implements full
  complex arithmetic in factoring, simplification, and functional values.
  <em>complex</em> is ordinarily off.
