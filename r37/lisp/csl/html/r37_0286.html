<p>
  When <em>ezgcd</em> and <a href="r37_0086.html">gcd</a> are on, greatest
  common divisors are computed using the EZ GCD algorithm that uses modular
  arithmetic (and is usually faster). Default is <em>off</em>.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  As a side effect of the gcd calculation, the expressions involved are
  factored, though not the heavy-duty factoring of
  <a href="r37_0151.html">factorize</a>. The EZ GCD algorithm was introduced in
  a paper by J. Moses and D.Y.Y. Yun in &lt;Proceedings of the ACM&gt;, 1973,
  pp. 159-166.

  Note that the
  <a href="r37_0086.html">gcd</a> switch must also be on for <em>ezgcd</em> to
  have effect.
