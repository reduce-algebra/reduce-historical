When <em>ezgcd</em> and 
<A HREF=r37_0086.html>gcd</A> are on, greatest common divisors are 
computed using the EZ GCD algorithm that uses modular arithmetic (and is 
usually faster). Default is <em>off</em>. 
<P>
<P>
As a side effect of the gcd calculation, the expressions involved are 
factored, though not the heavy-duty factoring of 
<A HREF=r37_0151.html>factorize</A>. The 
EZ GCD algorithm was introduced in a paper by J. Moses and D.Y.Y. Yun in 
&lt;Proceedings of the ACM&gt;, 1973, pp. 159-166.

Note that the 
<A HREF=r37_0086.html>gcd</A> switch must also be on for <em>ezgcd</em> to have 

effect.
