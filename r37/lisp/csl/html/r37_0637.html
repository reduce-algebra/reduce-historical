This package supports the computation with boolean expressions in the 
propositional calculus. The data objects are composed from algebraic 
expressions connected by the infix boolean operators and, or, 
 implies, equiv, and the unary prefix operator not. 
 Boolean allows you to simplify expressions built from these 
operators, and to test properties like equivalence, subset property etc.
