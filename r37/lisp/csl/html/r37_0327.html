Rlisp '88 is a superset of the Rlisp that has been traditionally used for 
the support of REDUCE. It is fully documented in the book Marti, J.B., 
``RLISP '88: An Evolutionary Approach to Program Design and Reuse'', 
World Scientific, Singapore (1993). It supports different looping 
constructs from the traditional Rlisp, and treats ``-'' as a letter unless 
separated by spaces. Turning on the switch <em>rlisp88</em> converts to 
Rlisp '88 parsing conventions in symbolic mode, and enables the use of 
Rlisp '88 extensions. Turning off the switch reverts to the traditional 
Rlisp and the previous mode ( (

<A HREF=r37_0186.html>algebraic</A>) 
in force before <em>rlisp88</em> was turned on.
