  Rlisp '88 is a superset of the Rlisp that has been traditionally used for the
  support of REDUCE. It is fully documented in the book Marti, J.B., ``RLISP
  '88: An Evolutionary Approach to Program Design and Reuse'', World Scientific,
  Singapore (1993). It supports different looping constructs from the
  traditional Rlisp, and treats ``-'' as a letter unless separated by spaces.
  Turning on the switch <em>rlisp88</em> converts to Rlisp '88 parsing
  conventions in symbolic mode, and enables the use of Rlisp '88 extensions.
  Turning off the switch reverts to the traditional Rlisp and the previous mode
  ( ( <a href="r37_0221.html">symbolic</a> or
  <a href="r37_0186.html">algebraic</a>) in force before <em>rlisp88</em> was
  turned on.
