The operator <em>num_fit</em> finds for a set of 
points the linear combination of a given set of 
functions (function basis) which approximates the 
points best under the objective of the <em>least squares</em> 
criterion (minimum of the sum of the squares of the deviation). 
The solution is found as zero of the 
gradient vector of the sum of squared errors.

<em>num_fit</em>(&lt;vals&gt;,&lt;basis&gt;,&lt;var&gt;=&lt;pts&gt;) 
<P>
<P>
<P>
where &lt;vals&gt; is a list of numeric values, 
&lt;var&gt; is a variable used for the approximation, 
&lt;pts&gt; is a list of coordinate values which correspond to 
&lt;var&gt;, 
&lt;basis&gt; is a set of functions varying in <em>var</em> which is used 
 for the approximation. 
 <P>
<P>
The result is a list containing as first element the 
function which approximates the given values, and as 
second element a list of coefficients which were used 
to build this function from the basis.
