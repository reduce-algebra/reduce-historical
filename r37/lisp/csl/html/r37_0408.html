  The High-energy Physics package is historic for REDUCE, since REDUCE
  originated as a program to aid in computations with Dirac expressions. The
  commutation algebra of the gamma matrices is independent of their
  representation, and is a natural subject for symbolic mathematics. Dirac
  theory is applied to beta decay and the computation of cross-sections and
  scattering. The high-energy physics operators are available in the REDUCE main
  program, rather than as a module which must be loaded.
