The High-energy Physics package is historic for REDUCE, since REDUCE 
originated as a program to aid in computations with Dirac expressions. 
The commutation algebra of the gamma matrices is independent of their 
representation, and is a natural subject for symbolic mathematics. Dirac 
theory is applied to beta decay and the computation of 
cross-sections and scattering. The high-energy physics operators are 
available in the REDUCE main program, rather than as a module which must 
be loaded.
