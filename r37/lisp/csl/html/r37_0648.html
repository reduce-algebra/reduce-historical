The <em>excalc</em> package is designed for easy use by all who are familiar 
with the calculus of Modern Differential Geometry. The program is currently 
able to handle scalar-valued exterior forms, vectors and operations between 
them, as well as non-scalar valued forms (indexed forms). It is thus an ideal 
tool for studying differential equations, doing calculations in general 
relativity and field theories, or doing simple things such as calculating the 
Laplacian of a tensor field for an arbitrary given frame.
