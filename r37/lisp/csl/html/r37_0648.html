  The <em>excalc</em> package is designed for easy use by all who are familiar
  with the calculus of Modern Differential Geometry. The program is currently
  able to handle scalar-valued exterior forms, vectors and operations between
  them, as well as non-scalar valued forms (indexed forms). It is thus an ideal
  tool for studying differential equations, doing calculations in general
  relativity and field theories, or doing simple things such as calculating the
  Laplacian of a tensor field for an arbitrary given frame.
