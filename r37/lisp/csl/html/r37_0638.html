  This package contains algorithms for computations in commutative algebra
  closely related to the Groebner algorithm for ideals and modules. Its heart is
  a new implementation of the Groebner algorithm that also allows for the
  computation of syzygies. This implementation is also applicable to submodules
  of free modules with generators represented as rows of a matrix.
