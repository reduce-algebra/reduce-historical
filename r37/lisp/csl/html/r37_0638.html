This package contains algorithms for computations in commutative algebra 
closely related to the Groebner algorithm for ideals and modules. Its 
heart is a new implementation of the Groebner algorithm that also allows 
for the computation of syzygies. This implementation is also applicable to 
submodules of free modules with generators represented as rows of a matrix.
