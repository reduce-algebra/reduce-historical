  This package defines a command command RESETREDUCE that works through the
  history of previous commands, and clears any values which have been assigned,
  plus any rules, arrays and the like. It also sets the various switches to
  their initial values. It is not complete, but does work for most things that
  cause a gradual loss of space. It would be relatively easy to make it
  interactive, so allowing for selective resetting.
