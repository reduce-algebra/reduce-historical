This package defines a command command RESETREDUCE that works through the 
history of previous commands, and clears any values which have been 
assigned, plus any rules, arrays and the like. It also sets the various 
switches to their initial values. It is not complete, but does work for 
most things that cause a gradual loss of space. It would be relatively 
easy to make it interactive, so allowing for selective resetting.
