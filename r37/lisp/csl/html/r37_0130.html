REDUCE's memory is in a storage structure called a heap. As REDUCE 
statements execute, chunks of memory are used up. When these chunks are no 
longer needed, they remain idle. When the memory is almost full, 
the system executes a garbage collection, reclaiming space that is no 
longer needed, and putting all the free space at one end. Depending on 
the size of the image REDUCE is using, 
garbage collection needs to be done more or less often. A 
larger image means fewer but longer garbage collections. 
Regardless of memory size, 
if you ask REDUCE to do something ridiculous, like <em>factorial(2000)</em>, it 
may 
garbage collect many times.
