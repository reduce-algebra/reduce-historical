The terms are separated into two groups where the 
second parameter of the 
<A HREF=r37_0354.html>torder</A> call determines 
the length of the first group. For a comparison first 
the total degrees of both variable groups are compared. 
If both are equal 

<A HREF=r37_0357.html>gradlex term order</A> comparison is applied to the first 

group, and if that does not decide 
<A HREF=r37_0357.html>gradlex term order</A> 
is applied for the second group. This order has the elimination 
property for the variable groups. It can be used e.g. for 
separating variables from parameters.
