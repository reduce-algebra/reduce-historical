  The terms are separated into two groups where the second parameter of the
  <a href="r37_0354.html">torder</a> call determines the length of the first
  group. For a comparison first the total degrees of both variable groups are
  compared. If both are equal

  <a href="r37_0357.html">gradlex term order</a> comparison is applied to the
  first group, and if that does not decide
  <a href="r37_0357.html">gradlex term order</a>
  is applied for the second group. This order has the elimination property for
  the variable groups. It can be used e.g. for separating variables from
  parameters.
