TRIGSIMP is a useful tool for all kinds of trigonometric and hyperbolic 
simplification and factorization. There are three procedures included in 
TRIGSIMP: <em>trigsimp</em>, <em>trigfactorize</em> and <em>triggcd</em>. The 
first is for finding simplifications of trigonometric or hyperbolic 
expressions with many options, the second for factorizing them and the 
third for finding the greatest common divisor of two trigonometric or 
hyperbolic polynomials.
