  The GNUPLOT system provides easy to use graphics output for curves or surfaces
  which are defined by formulas and/or data sets. GNUPLOT supports a great
  variety of output devices such as X-windows, VGA screen, postscript, picTeX.
  The REDUCE GNUPLOT package lets one use the GNUPLOT graphical output directly
  from inside REDUCE, either for the interactive display of curves/surfaces or
  for the production of pictures on paper.

<p>Note that this package may not be supported on all system platforms.</p>

  For a detailed description you should read the GNUPLOT system documentation,
  available together with the GNUPLOT installation material from several servers
  by anonymous FTP.

  The REDUCE developers thank the GNUPLOT people for their permission to
  distribute GNUPLOT together with REDUCE.
