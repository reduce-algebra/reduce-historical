The GNUPLOT system provides easy to use graphics output 
for curves or surfaces which are defined by 
formulas and/or data sets. GNUPLOT supports 
a great variety of output devices 
such as X-windows, VGA screen, postscript, picTeX. 
The REDUCE GNUPLOT package lets one use the GNUPLOT 
graphical output directly from inside REDUCE, either for 
the interactive display of curves/surfaces or for the production 
of pictures on paper.

Note that this package may not be supported on all system 
platforms.

For a detailed description you should read the GNUPLOT 
system documentation, available together with the GNUPLOT 
installation material from several servers by anonymous FTP.

The REDUCE developers thank the GNUPLOT people for their permission 
to distribute GNUPLOT together with REDUCE.
