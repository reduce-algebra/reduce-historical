<p><b>VECTOR</b> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ <b>declaration</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>vector</em> declaration declares that its arguments are of type
  <em>vect or</em>.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>vector</em>&lt;identifier&gt;{,&lt;identifier&gt;}*</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;identifier&gt; must be a valid REDUCE identifier. It may have already been
  used for a matrix, array, operator or scalar variable. After an identifier has
  been declared to be a vector, it may not be used as a scalar variable.
</p>

<p>
  Vectors are special entities for high-energy physics calculations. You cannot
  put values into their coordinates; they do not have coordinates. They are
  legal arguments for the high-energy physics operators

  <a href="r37_0410.html">eps</a>, <a href="r37_0411.html">g</a> and
  <em>.</em> (dot). Vector variables are used to represent gamma matrices and
  gamma matrices contracted with Lorentz 4-vectors, since there are no Dirac
  variables per se in the system. Vectors do follow the usual vector rules for
  arithmetic operations: <em>+</em> and <em>-</em> operate upon two or more
  vectors, producing a vector; <em>*</em> and <em>/</em> cannot be used between
  vectors; the scalar product is represented by the . operator; and the product
  of a scalar and vector expression is well defined, and is a vector.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  You can represent components of vectors by including representations of unit
  vectors in your system. For instance, letting <em>E0</em> represent the unit
  vector (1,0,0,0), the command
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  <em>V1.E0 := 0;</em>would set up the substitution of zero for the first
  componen t of the vector <em>V1</em>.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Identifiers that are declared by the <em>index</em> and
  <em>mass</em> declaratio ns are automatically declared to be vectors.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The following errors can occur in calculations using the high energy physics
  package:
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  <em>A represents only gamma5 in vector expressions</em>You have tried to use A
  i n some way other than gamma5 in a high-energy physics expression.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  <em>Gamma5 not allowed unless vecdim is 4</em>You have used gamma_5 in a
  high-en ergy physics computation involving a vector dimension other than 4.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;ID&gt; <em>has no mass</em></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  One of the arguments to
  <a href="r37_0414.html">mshell</a> has had no mass assigned to it, in
  high-energy physics calculations.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  <em>Missing arguments for G operator</em>A line symbol is missing in a gamma
  mat rix expression in high-energy physics calculations.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Unmatched index</em>&lt;list&gt;</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The parser has found unmatched indices during the evaluation of a gamma matrix
  expression in high-energy physics calculations.
