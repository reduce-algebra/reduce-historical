When <em>output</em> is off, no output is printed from any REDUCE calculation. 
The calculations have their usual effects other than printing. Default is 
<em>on</em>.

<P>
Turn output <em>off</em> if you do not wish to see output when executing 
large files, or to save the time REDUCE spends formatting large expressions 
for display. Results are still available with 
<A HREF=r37_0184.html>ws</A>, or in their 
assigned variables.
