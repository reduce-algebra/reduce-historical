<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>ws</em> operator alone returns the last result; <em>ws</em> with a
  number argument returns the results of the REDUCE statement executed after
  that numbered prompt.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>ws</em>or <em>ws</em>(&lt;number&gt;)</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;number&gt; must be an integer between 1 and the current REDUCE prompt
  number .

  <em>ws</em>and <em>ws</em><em>(</em>&lt;number&gt;<em>)</em> can be used
  anywher e the expression they stand for can be used. Calling a number for
  which no result was produced, such as a switch setting, will give an error
  message.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The current workspace always contains the results of the last REDUCE command
  that produced an expression, even if several input statements that do not
  produce expressions have intervened. For example, if you do a differentiation,
  producing a result expression, then change several switches, the operator
  <em>ws;</em> returns the results of the differentiation. The current workspace
  (<em>ws</em>) can also be used inside files, though the numbered workspace
  contains only the <em>in</em> command that input the file.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  There are three history lists kept in your REDUCE session. The first stores
  raw input, suitable for the statement editor. The second stores parsed input,
  ready to execute and accessible by
  <a href="r37_0232.html">input</a>. The third stores results, when they are
  produced by statements, which are accessible by the <em>ws</em>&lt; n&gt;
  operator. If your session is very long, storage space begins to fill up with
  these expressions, so it is a good idea to end the session once in a while,
  saving needed expressions to files with the
  <a href="r37_0133.html">saveas</a> and
  <a href="r37_0233.html">out</a> commands.

<p>An error message is given if a reference number has not yet been used.</p>
