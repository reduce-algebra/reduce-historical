The command <em>end</em> has two main uses: 
<P>
<P>
 _ _ _ (i) 
as the ending of a 
<A HREF=r37_0040.html>begin</A>...<em>end</em> 
<A HREF=r37_0041.html>block</A>; and 
<P>
 _ _ _ (ii) 
to end input from a file. 
<P>
<P>
In a <em>begin</em>...<em>end</em> 
<A HREF=r37_0041.html>block</A>, there need not be a delimiter 
(<em>;</em> or <em>$</em>) before the <em>end</em>, though there must be one 
after it, or a right bracket matching an earlier left bracket. 
<P>
<P>
Files to be read into REDUCE should end with <em>end;</em>, which must be 
preceded by a semicolon (usually the last character of the previous line). 
The additional semicolon avoids problems with mistakes in the files. If 
you have suspended file operation by answering <em>n</em> to a <em>pause</em> 
command, you are still, technically speaking, ``in&quot; the file. Use 
<em>end</em> to exit the file. 
<P>
<P>
An <em>end</em> at the top level of a program is ignored.
