<p><b>END</b> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ <b>command</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>The command <em>end</em> has two main uses:</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  _ _ _ (i) as the ending of a
  <a href="r37_0040.html">begin</a>...<em>end</em>
  <a href="r37_0041.html">block</a>; and
</p>

<p>_ _ _ (ii) to end input from a file.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  In a <em>begin</em>...<em>end</em> <a href="r37_0041.html">block</a>, there
  need not be a delimiter (<em>;</em> or <em>$</em>) before the <em>end</em>,
  though there must be one after it, or a right bracket matching an earlier left
  bracket.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Files to be read into REDUCE should end with <em>end;</em>, which must be
  preceded by a semicolon (usually the last character of the previous line). The
  additional semicolon avoids problems with mistakes in the files. If you have
  suspended file operation by answering <em>n</em> to a <em>pause</em>
  command, you are still, technically speaking, ``in&quot; the file. Use
  <em>end</em> to exit the file.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>An <em>end</em> at the top level of a program is ignored.</p>
