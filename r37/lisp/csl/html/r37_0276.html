When the <em>cramer</em> switch is on, 
<A HREF=r37_0345.html>matrix</A> inversion 
and linear equation 
solving (operator 
<A HREF=r37_0179.html>solve</A>) is done by Cramer's rule, through exterior 
multiplication. Default is <em>off</em>.

After you invert the matrix, turn on 
<A HREF=r37_0314.html>output</A> and ask for one of 
the elements of the inverse matrix, such as <em>cramersinv(3,2)</em>, so that 
you can see the size of the expressions produced.

Inversion of matrices and the solution of linear equations with dense 
symbolic entries in many variables is generally considerably faster with 
<em>cramer</em> on. However, inversion of numeric-valued matrices is 
slower. Consider the matrices you're inverting before deciding whether to 
turn <em>cramer</em> on or off. A substantial portion of the time in matrix 
inversion is given to formatting the results for printing. To save this 
time, turn <em>output</em> off, as shown in this example or terminate the 
expression with a dollar sign instead of a semicolon. The results are 
still available to you in the workspace associated with your prompt 
number, or you can assign them to an identifier for further use.
