  When the <em>cramer</em> switch is on,
  <a href="r37_0345.html">matrix</a> inversion and linear equation solving
  (operator <a href="r37_0179.html">solve</a>) is done by Cramer's rule, through
  exterior multiplication. Default is <em>off</em>.

<p>
  Your time readings will vary depending on the REDUCE version you u se. After
  you invert the matrix, turn on <a href="r37_0314.html">output</a> and ask for
  one of the elements of the inverse matrix, such as <em>cramersinv(3,2)</em>,
  so that you can see the size of the expressions produced.

<p>
  Inversion of matrices and the solution of linear equations with dense symbolic
  entries in many variables is generally considerably faster with
  <em>cramer</em> on. However, inversion of numeric-valued matrices is slower.
  Consider the matrices you're inverting before deciding whether to turn
  <em>cramer</em> on or off. A substantial portion of the time in matrix
  inversion is given to formatting the results for printing. To save this time,
  turn <em>output</em> off, as shown in this example or terminate the expression
  with a dollar sign instead of a semicolon. The results are still available to
  you in the workspace associated with your prompt number, or you can assign
  them to an identifier for further use.
