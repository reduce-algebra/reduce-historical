</TT></PRE><P>By using <em>rational</em>, polynomial expressions with rational 
coefficients can be used in some commands that expect polynomials. With 
<em>rational</em> off, such a polynomial becomes a rational expression, with 
denominator the least common multiple of the denominators of the rational 
number coefficients. <P>
