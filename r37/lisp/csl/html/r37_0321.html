When the <em>rat</em> switch is on, and kernels have been selected to display 
with the 
<A HREF=r37_0287.html>factor</A> declaration, the denominator is printed with ea
ch 
term rather than one common denominator at the end of an expression.

</TT></PRE><P>The <em>rat</em> switch only has effect when the 
<A HREF=r37_0319.html>pri</A> switch is on. 
When <em>pri</em> is off, regardless of the setting of <em>rat</em>, the 
printing behavior is as if <em>rat</em> were off. <em>rat</em> only has 
effect upon the display of expressions, not their internal form.
