  The <em>algint</em> package provides indefinite integration of square roots.
  This package, which is an extension of the basic integration package
  distributed with REDUCE, will analytically integrate a wide range of
  expressions involving square roots. The
  <a href="r37_0265.html">algint</a> switch provides for the use of the
  facilities given by the package, and is automatically turned on when the
  package is loaded. If you want to return to the standard integration
  algorithms, turn <a href="r37_0265.html">algint</a> off. An error message is
  given if you try to turn the <a href="r37_0265.html">algint</a> switch on when
  its package is not loaded.
