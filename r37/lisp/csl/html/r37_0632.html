The <em>algint</em> package provides indefinite integration of square roots. 
This package, which is an extension of the basic integration package 
distributed with REDUCE, will analytically integrate a wide range of 
expressions involving square roots. The 
<A HREF=r37_0265.html>algint</A> switch provides for 
the use of the facilities given by the package, and is automatically turned 
on when the package is loaded. If you want to return to the standard 
integration algorithms, turn 
<A HREF=r37_0265.html>algint</A> off. An error message is given 
if you try to turn the 
<A HREF=r37_0265.html>algint</A> switch on when its package is not 
loaded.
