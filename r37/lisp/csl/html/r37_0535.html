 The <em>taylor</em> operator is used for expanding an expression into a 
 Taylor series.

<em>taylor</em>(&lt;expression&gt;

&lt;expression&gt; can be any valid REDUCE algebraic expression. 
 &lt;var&gt; must be a 
<A HREF=r37_0002.html>kernel</A>, and is the expansion 
 variable. The &lt;expression&gt; following it denotes the point 
 about which the expansion is to take place. &lt;number&gt; must be a 
 non-negative integer and denotes the maximum expansion order. If 
 more than one triple is specified <em>taylor</em> will expand its 
 first argument independently with respect to all the variables. 
 Note that once the expansion has been done it is not possible to 
 calculate higher orders. 
<P>
<P>
Instead of a 
<A HREF=r37_0002.html>kernel</A>, &lt;var&gt; may also be a list of 
 kernels. In this case expansion will take place in a way so that 
 the sum/ of the degrees of the kernels does not exceed the 
 maximum expansion order. If the expansion point evaluates to the 
 special identifier <em>infinity</em>, <em>taylor</em> tries to expand in 
 a series in 1/&lt;var&gt;. 
<P>
<P>
The expansion is performed variable per variable, i.e. in the 
 example above by first expanding 
 exp(x^2+y^2) 
 with respect to 
 <em>x</em> and then expanding every coefficient with respect to <em>y</em>.

Note that it is not generally possible to apply the standard 
 reduce operators to a Taylor kernel. For example, 
<A HREF=r37_0169.html>part</A>, 
 
<A HREF=r37_0141.html>coeff</A>, or 
<A HREF=r37_0142.html>coeffn</A> cannot be used. Instead, the 
 expression at hand has to be converted to standard form first 
 using the 
<A HREF=r37_0546.html>taylortostandard</A> operator. 
<P>
<P>
Differentiation of a Taylor expression is possible. If you 
 differentiate with respect to one of the Taylor variables the 
 order will decrease by one. 
<P>
<P>
Substitution is a bit restricted: Taylor variables can only be 
 replaced by other kernels. There is one exception to this rule: 
 you can always substitute a Taylor variable by an expression that 
 evaluates to a constant. Note that REDUCE will not always be able 
 to determine that an expression is constant: an example is 
 sin(acos(4)). 
<P>
<P>
Only simple taylor kernels can be integrated. More complicated 
 expressions that contain Taylor kernels as parts of themselves are 
 automatically converted into a standard representation by means of 
 the 
<A HREF=r37_0546.html>taylortostandard</A> operator. In this case a suitable 
 warning is printed.
