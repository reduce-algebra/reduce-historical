<p><b>TAYLOR</b> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ <b>operator</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>taylor</em> operator is used for expanding an expression into a Taylor
  series.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<em>taylor</em>(&lt;expression&gt; <em>,</em>&lt;var&gt;<em>,</em>
&lt;expression&gt;<em>,</em>&lt;number&gt;
<p></p>
<p>
  {<em>,</em>&lt;var&gt;<em>,</em> &lt;expression&gt;<em>,</em>&lt;number&gt;}*)
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;expression&gt; can be any valid REDUCE algebraic expression. &lt;var&gt;
  must be a
  <a href="r37_0002.html">kernel</a>, and is the expansion variable. The
  &lt;expression&gt; following it denotes the point about which the expansion is
  to take place. &lt;number&gt; must be a non-negative integer and denotes the
  maximum expansion order. If more than one triple is specified
  <em>taylor</em> will expand its first argument independently with respect to
  all the variables. Note that once the expansion has been done it is not
  possible to calculate higher orders.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Instead of a
  <a href="r37_0002.html">kernel</a>, &lt;var&gt; may also be a list of kernels.
  In this case expansion will take place in a way so that the sum/ of the
  degrees of the kernels does not exceed the maximum expansion order. If the
  expansion point evaluates to the special identifier <em>infinity</em>,
  <em>taylor</em> tries to expand in a series in 1/&lt;var&gt;.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The expansion is performed variable per variable, i.e. in the example above by
  first expanding exp(x^2+y^2) with respect to
  <em>x</em> and then expanding every coefficient with respect to <em>y</em>.
</p>

<h3>examples:</h3>
<p></p>
<pre><TT>
    taylor(e^(x^2+y^2),x,0,2,y,0,2); 


       2    2    2  2      2  2
  1 + Y  + X  + Y *X  + O(X ,Y )   


    taylor(e^(x^2+y^2),{x,y},0,2); 


       2    2       2  2
  1 + Y  + X  + O({X ,Y })

</TT></PRE>
<p>The following example shows the case of a non-analytical function.</p>
<p></p>
<pre><TT>

    taylor(x*y/(x+y),x,0,2,y,0,2); 


  ***** Not a unit in argument to QUOTTAYLOR

<p>
  Note that it is not generally possible to apply the standard reduce operators
  to a Taylor kernel. For example,
  <a href="r37_0169.html">part</a>,

  <a href="r37_0141.html">coeff</a>, or
  <a href="r37_0142.html">coeffn</a> cannot be used. Instead, the expression at
  hand has to be converted to standard form first using the
  <a href="r37_0546.html">taylortostandard</a> operator.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Differentiation of a Taylor expression is possible. If you differentiate with
  respect to one of the Taylor variables the order will decrease by one.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Substitution is a bit restricted: Taylor variables can only be replaced by
  other kernels. There is one exception to this rule: you can always substitute
  a Taylor variable by an expression that evaluates to a constant. Note that
  REDUCE will not always be able to determine that an expression is constant: an
  example is sin(acos(4)).
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Only simple taylor kernels can be integrated. More complicated expressions
  that contain Taylor kernels as parts of themselves are automatically converted
  into a standard representation by means of the
  <a href="r37_0546.html">taylortostandard</a> operator. In this case a suitable
  warning is printed.
