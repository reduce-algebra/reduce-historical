  When a matrix variable has not been dimensioned, matrix elements c annot be
  referenced until the matrix is set by the
  <a href="r37_0343.html">mat</a> operator. When a matrix is dimensioned in its
  declaration, matrix elements are set to 0. Matrix elements cannot stand for
  themselves. When you use <a href="r37_0199.html">let</a> on a matrix element,
  there is no effect unless the element contains a constant, in which case an
  error message is returned. The same behavior occurs with
  <a href="r37_0189.html">clear</a>. Do &lt;not&gt; use
  <a href="r37_0189.html">clear</a> to try to set a matrix element to 0.
  <a href="r37_0199.html">let</a> statements can be applied to matrices as a
  whole, if the right-hand side of the expression is a matrix expression, and
  the left-hand side identifier has been declared to be a matrix.

  Arithmetical operators apply to matrices of the correct dimensions. The
  operators <em>+</em> and <em>-</em> can be used with matrices of the same
  dimensions. The operator <em>*</em> can be used to multiply m x n matrices by
  n x p matrices. Matrix multiplication is non-commutative. Scalars can also be
  multiplied with matrices, with the result that each element of the matrix is
  multiplied by the scalar. The operator <em>/</em> applied to two matrices
  computes the first matrix multiplied by the inverse of the second, if the
  inverse exists, and produces an error message otherwise. Matrices can be
  divided by scalars, which results in dividing each element of the matrix.
  Scalars can also be divided by matrices when the matrices are invertible, and
  the result is the multiplication of the scalar by the inverse of the matrix.
  Matrix inverses can by found by <em>1/A</em> or <em>/A</em>, where
  <em>A</em> is a matrix. Square matrices can be raised to positive integer
  powers, and also to negative integer powers if they are nonsingular.

  When a matrix variable is assigned to the results of a calculation, the matrix
  is redimensioned if necessary.
