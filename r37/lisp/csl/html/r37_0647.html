  This package allows a user to find the canonical form of expressions involving
  dummy variables. In that way, the simplification of polynomial expressions can
  be fully done. The indeterminates are general operator objects endowed with as
  few properties as possible. In that way the package may be used in a large
  spectrum of applications.
