There are a few constants known to the special function package, namely 
<P>
<P>
 _ _ _ <em>Euler's constant </em>(which can be computed as -
<A HREF=r37_0493.html>Psi</A>(1)) and 
<P>
 _ _ _ <em>Khinchin's constant</em> (which is defined in Khinchin's book 
 ``Continued Fractions'') and 
<P>
 _ _ _ <em>Golden_Ratio</em> (which can be computed as (1 + sqrt 5)/2) and 
<P>
 _ _ _ <em>Catalan's constant</em> (which is known as an infinite sum of recipro
cal 
powers)
