<p>
  In conjunction with
  <a href="r37_0226.html">weight</a>, <em>wtlevel</em> is used to implement
  asymptotic constraints. Its default value is 2.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>wtlevel</em>&lt;expression&gt;</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  To change the weight level, &lt;expression&gt; must evaluate to a positive
  integer that is the greatest weight term to be retained in expressions
  involving kernels with weight assignments. <em>wtlevel</em> returns the new
  weight level. If you want the current weight level, but not change it, say
  <em>wtlevel nil</em>.

<p>
  <em>wtlevel</em>is used in conjunction with the command
  <a href="r37_0226.html">weight</a> to enable asymptotic constraints. Weight of
  a term is computed by multiplying the weights of each variable in it by the
  power to which it has been raised, and adding the resulting weights for each
  variable. If the weight of the term is greater than <em>wtlevel</em>, the term
  is dropped from the expression, and not used in any further computation
  involving the expression.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Once a weight has been attached to a
  <a href="r37_0002.html">kernel</a>, it is no longer recognized by the system
  as a kernel, though still a variable. It cannot be used in REDUCE commands and
  operators that need kernels. The weight attachment can be undone with a
  <a href="r37_0189.html">clear</a> command. <em>wtlevel</em> can be changed as
  desired.
