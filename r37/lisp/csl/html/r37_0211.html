<p></p>
<p>Use the <em>operator</em> declaration to declare your own operators.</p>

<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>operator</em>&lt;identifier&gt;{,&lt;identifier&gt;}*</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;identifier&gt; can be any valid REDUCE identifier, which is not the name
  of a
  <a href="r37_0345.html">matrix</a>, <a href="r37_0188.html">array</a>, scalar
  variable or previously-defined operator.

<p>
  The first operator is the Euclidean distance metric, the distance of point
  (x,y) from the origin. The second operator is the factorial.

<p>
  Operators can have various properties assigned to them; they can be declared
  <a href="r37_0196.html">infix</a>, <a href="r37_0200.html">linear</a>,
  <a href="r37_0222.html">symmetric</a>,

  <a href="r37_0187.html">antisymmetric</a>, or
  <a href="r37_0206.html">noncom</a><em>mutative</em>. The default operator is
  prefix, nonlinear, and commutative. Precedence can also be assigned to
  operators using the declaration

  <a href="r37_0213.html">precedence</a>.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Functionality is assigned to an operator by a
  <a href="r37_0199.html">let</a> statement or a
  <a href="r37_0195.html">forall</a>...<em>let</em> statement, (or possibly by a
  procedure with the name of the operator). Be careful not to redefine a system
  operator by accident. REDUCE permits you to redefine system operators, giving
  you a warning message that the operator was already defined. This flexibility
  allows you to add mathematical rules that do what you want them to do, but can
  produce odd or erroneous behavior if you are not careful.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  You can declare operators from inside
  <a href="r37_0055.html">procedure</a>s, as long as they are not local
  variables. Operators defined inside procedures are global. A formal parameter
  may be declared as an operator, and has the effect of declaring the calling
  variable as the operator.
