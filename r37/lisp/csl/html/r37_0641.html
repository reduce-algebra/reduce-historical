  COMPACT is a package of functions for the reduction of a polynomial in the
  presence of side relations. COMPACT applies the side relations to the
  polynomial so that an equivalent expression results with as few terms as
  possible. For example, the evaluation of
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<pre><TT>
     compact(s*(1-sin x^2)+c*(1-cos x^2)+sin x^2+cos x^2,
             {cos x^2+sin x^2=1});

</TT></PRE>
<p>yields the result</p>
<p></p>
<pre><TT>

              2           2
        SIN(X) *C + COS(X) *S + 1
</TT></PRE>

  The first argument to the operator <em>compact</em> is the expression and the
  second is a list of side relations that can be equations or simple expressions
  (implicitly equated to zero). The kernels in the side relations may also be
  free variables with the same meaning as in rules, e.g.
</p>

<p></p>
<pre><TT>
     sin_cos_identity :=  {cos ~w^2+sin ~w^2=1}$
     compact(u,in_cos_identity);
</TT></PRE>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Also the full rule syntax with the replacement operator is allowed here.</p>
