The constant <em>e</em> is reserved for use as the base of the natural 
logarithm. Its value is approximately 2.71828284590, which REDUCE gives 
to the current decimal precision when the switch 
<A HREF=r37_0330.html>rounded</A> is on. 
<P>
<P>
<em>e</em>may be used as an iterative variable in a 
<A HREF=r37_0047.html>for</A> statement, 
or as a local variable or a 
<A HREF=r37_0055.html>procedure</A>. If <em>e</em> is defined 
as a local 
variable inside the procedure, the normal definition as the base of the 
natural logarithm would be suspended inside the procedure.
