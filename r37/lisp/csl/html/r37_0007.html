<p>
  The constant <em>e</em> is reserved for use as the base of the natural
  logarithm. Its value is approximately 2.71828284590, which REDUCE gives to the
  current decimal precision when the switch
  <a href="r37_0330.html">rounded</a> is on.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  <em>e</em>may be used as an iterative variable in a
  <a href="r37_0047.html">for</a> statement, or as a local variable or a
  <a href="r37_0055.html">procedure</a>. If <em>e</em> is defined as a local
  variable inside the procedure, the normal definition as the base of the
  natural logarithm would be suspended inside the procedure.
