Under normal circumstances, the printing routines try to break an expression 
across lines at a natural point. This is a fairly expensive process. If 
you are not overly concerned about where the end-of-line breaks come, you 
can speed up the printing of expressions by turning off the switch 
<em>nosplit</em>. This switch is normally on.
