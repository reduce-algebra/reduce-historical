The package <em>spde</em> provides a set of functions which may be used to 
determine the symmetry group of Lie- or point-symmetries of a given system of 
partial differential equations. In many cases the determining system is 
solved completely automatically. In other cases the user has to provide 
additional input information for the solution algorithm to terminate.
