  The package <em>spde</em> provides a set of functions which may be used to
  determine the symmetry group of Lie- or point-symmetries of a given system of
  partial differential equations. In many cases the determining system is solved
  completely automatically. In other cases the user has to provide additional
  input information for the solution algorithm to terminate.
