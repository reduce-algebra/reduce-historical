The grid for localizing an implicitly defined curve in 
<A HREF=r37_0551.html>plot</A> 
consists of triangles. These are computed initially equally distributed 
over the x-y plane controlled by 
<A HREF=r37_0565.html>plot_xmesh</A>. The grid is 
refined adaptively in several levels. The final grid can be visualized 
by setting on the switch <em>show_grid</em>.
