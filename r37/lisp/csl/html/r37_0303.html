If an operator other than those specifically defined for lists is given a 
single argument that is a list, then the result of this operation will be 
a list in which that operator is applied to each element of the list. 
This process can be inhibited globally by turning on the switch 
<em>listargs</em>.

on listargs; 

log {a,b,c}; 

  LOG(A,B,C)

</TT></PRE><P>It is possible to inhibit such distribution for a specific operato
r by 
using the declaration 
<A HREF=r37_0203.html>listargp</A>. In addition, if an operator has 
more than one argument, no such distribution occurs, so <em>listargs</em> 
has no effect.
