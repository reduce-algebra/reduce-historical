The switch <em>cref</em> invokes the CREF cross-reference program that 
processes a set of procedure definitions to produce a summary of their 
entry points, undefined procedures, non-local variables and so on. The 
program will also check that procedures are called with a consistent 
number of arguments, and print a diagnostic message otherwise. 
<P>
<P>
The output is alphabetized on the first seven characters of each function 
name. 
<P>
<P>
To invoke the cross-reference program, <em>cref</em> is first turned on. 
This causes the program to load and the cross-referencing process to 
begin. After all the required definitions are loaded, turning <em>cref</em> 
off will cause a cross-reference listing to be produced. 
<P>
<P>
Algebraic procedures in REDUCE are treated as if they were symbolic, so 
that algebraic constructs will actually appear as calls to symbolic 
functions, such as <em>aeval</em>.
