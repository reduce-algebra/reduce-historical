</TT></PRE><P>The division operator is left associative, so that <em>a/b/c</em> 
is equivalent 
to <em>(a/b)/c</em>. The division operator is also valid with square 

<A HREF=r37_0345.html>matrix</A> expressions of the same dimensions: With A and 

B both n x n matrices and B 
invertible, A/B is 
given by A*B^-1. 
Division of a matrix by a scalar is defined, with the results being the 
division of each element of the matrix by the scalar. Division of a 
scalar by a matrix is defined if the matrix is invertible, and has the 
effect of multiplying the scalar by the inverse of the matrix. When 
<em>/</em> is used as a reciprocal operator for a matrix, the inverse of 
the matrix is returned if it exists.
