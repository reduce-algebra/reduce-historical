  This package performs automation of the process of numerically solving partial
  differential equations systems (PDES) by means of computer algebra. For PDES
  solving, the finite difference method is applied. The computer algebra system
  REDUCE and the numerical programming language FORTRAN are used in the
  presented methodology. The main aim of this methodology is to speed up the
  process of preparing numerical programs for solving PDES. This process is
  quite often, especially for complicated systems, a tedious and time consuming
  task.
