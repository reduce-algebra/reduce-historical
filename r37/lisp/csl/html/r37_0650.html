This package performs automation of the process of numerically 
solving partial differential equations systems (PDES) by means of 
computer algebra. For PDES solving, the finite difference method is applied. 
The computer algebra system REDUCE and the numerical programming 
language FORTRAN are used in the presented methodology. The main aim of 
this methodology is to speed up the process of preparing numerical 
programs for solving PDES. This process is quite often, especially for 
complicated systems, a tedious and time consuming task.
