When <em>modular</em> is on, polynomial coefficients are reduced by the 
modulus set by 
<A HREF=r37_0104.html>setmod</A>. If no modulus has been set, <em>modular</em> 
has no effect.

</TT></PRE><P>Modular operations are only conducted on the coefficients, not the
 
exponents. The modulus is not restricted to being prime. When the modulus 
is prime, division by a number not relatively prime to the modulus results 
in a &lt;Zero divisor&gt; error message. When the modulus is a composite 
number, division by a power of the modulus results in an error message, but 
division by an integer which is a factor of the modulus does not.
