The . operator is used to denote the scalar product of two Lorentz 
four-vectors.

&lt;vector&gt; <em>.</em> &lt;vector&gt;

<P>
&lt;vector&gt; must be an identifier declared to be of type <em>vector</em> to h
ave 
the scalar product definition. When applied to arguments that are not 
vectors, the 
<A HREF=r37_0043.html>cons</A> operator is used, 
whose symbol is also ``dot.''

</TT></PRE><P>Since vectors are special high-energy physics entities that do not
 contain 
values, the . product will not return a true scalar product. You can 
assign a scalar identifier to the result of a . operation, or assign a . 
operation to have the value of the scalar you supply, as shown above. Note 
that the result of a . operation is a scalar, not a vector.

The metric tensor g(u,v) can be represented by <em>u.v</em>. If contraction 
over the indices is required, <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> should be declared to 
be of type 
<A HREF=r37_0412.html>index</A>. 
<P>
<P>
The dot operator has the highest precedence of the infix operators, so 
expressions involving . and other operators have the scalar product 
evaluated first before other operations are done.
