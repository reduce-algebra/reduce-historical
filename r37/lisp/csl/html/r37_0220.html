<p><b>SHARE</b> _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ <b>declaration</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>share</em> declaration allows access to its arguments by both
  algebraic and symbolic modes.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>share</em>&lt;identifier&gt;{,&lt;identifier&gt;}*</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;identifier&gt; can be any valid REDUCE identifier.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Programming in
  <a href="r37_0221.html">symbolic</a> as well as algebraic mode allows you a
  wider range of techniques than just algebraic mode alone. Expressions do not
  cross the boundary since they have different representations, unless the
  <em>share</em> declaration is used. For more information on using symbolic
  mode, see the &lt;REDUCE User's Manual&gt;, and the &lt;Standard Lisp
  Report&gt;.

<p>
  You should be aware that a previously-declared array is destroyed by the
  <em>share</em> declaration. Scalar variables retain their values. You can
  share a declared <a href="r37_0345.html">matrix</a> that has not yet been
  dimensioned so that it can be used by both modes. Values that are later put
  into the matrix are accessible from symbolic mode too, but not by the usual
  matrix reference mechanism. In symbolic mode, a matrix is stored as a list
  whose first element is <a href="r37_0343.html">MAT</a>, and whose next
  elements are the rows of the matri x stored as lists of the individual
  elements. Access in symbolic mode is by the operators
  <a href="r37_0046.html">first</a>, <a href="r37_0063.html">second</a>,
  <a href="r37_0066.html">third</a> and

  <a href="r37_0057.html">rest</a>.
