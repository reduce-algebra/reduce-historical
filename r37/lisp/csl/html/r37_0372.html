If <em>groebprereduce</em> set ON, 
<A HREF=r37_0368.html>groebner</A> 
and 
<A HREF=r37_0390.html>groebnerf</A> try to simplify the 
input expressions: if the head term of an input expression is a 
multiple of the head term of another expression, it can be reduced; 
these reductions are done cyclicly as long as possible in order to 
shorten the main part of the algorithm.
