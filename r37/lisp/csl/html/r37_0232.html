<P>
The <em>input</em> command returns the input expression to the REDUCE numbered 
prompt that is its argument. 
 <P> <H3> 
syntax: </H3>
<P>
<P>
<em>input</em>(&lt;number&gt;) or <em>input</em> &lt;number&gt; 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
&lt;number&gt; must be between 1 and the current REDUCE prompt number. 
<P>
<P>
An expression brought back by <em>input</em> can be reexecuted with new 
values or switch settings, or used as an argument in another expression. 
The command 
<A HREF=r37_0184.html>ws</A> brings back the results of a numbered REDUCE 
statement. Two lists contain every input and every output statement since 
the beginning of the session. If your session is very long, storage space 
begins to fill up with these expressions, so it is a good idea to end the 
session once in a while, saving needed expressions to files with the 

<A HREF=r37_0133.html>saveas</A> and 
<A HREF=r37_0233.html>out</A> commands. 
<P>
<P>
Switch settings and 
<A HREF=r37_0199.html>let</A> statements can also be reexecuted by using 
<em>input</em>. 
<P>
<P>
An error message is given if a number is called for that has not yet been used.
