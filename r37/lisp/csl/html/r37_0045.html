  An <em>equation</em> is an expression where two algebraic expressions are
  connected by the (infix) operator <a href="r37_0110.html">equal</a> or by
  <em>=</em>. For access to the components of an <em>equation</em> the operators

  <a href="r37_0158.html">lhs</a>, <a href="r37_0175.html">rhs</a> or
  <a href="r37_0169.html">part</a> can be used. The evaluation of the left-hand
  side of an <em>equation</em> is controlled by the switch
  <a href="r37_0283.html">evallhseqp</a>, while the right-hand side is evaluated
  unconditionally. When an <em>equation</em> is part of a logical expression,
  e.g. in a <a href="r37_0052.html">if</a> or
  <a href="r37_0228.html">while</a> statement, the equation is evaluated by
  subtracting both sides can comparing the result with zero.
</p>

<p>
  Equations occur in many contexts, e.g. as arguments of the
  <a href="r37_0182.html">sub</a>
  operator and in the arguments and the results of the operator
  <a href="r37_0179.html">solve</a>. An equation can be member of a
  <a href="r37_0302.html">list</a>
  and you may assign an equation to a variable. Elementary arithmetic is
  supported for equations: if
  <a href="r37_0283.html">evallhseqp</a> is on, you may add and subtract
  equations, and you can combine an equation with a scalar expression by
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and raise an equation to a
  power.

  Important: the equation must occur in the leftmost term of such an expression.
  For other operations, e.g. taking function values of both sides, use the

  <a href="r37_0163.html">map</a> operator.
