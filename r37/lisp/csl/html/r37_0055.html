The <em>procedure</em> command allows you to define a mathematical operation as 
a 
function with arguments.

The &lt;option&gt; may be 
<A HREF=r37_0186.html>algebraic</A> or 
<A HREF=r37_0221.html>symbolic</A>, 
indicating the 
mode under which the procedure is executed, or 
<A HREF=r37_0216.html>real</A> or 

<A HREF=r37_0197.html>integer</A>, indicating the type of answer expected. The d
efault is 
algebraic. Real or integer procedures are subtypes of algebraic 
procedures; type-checking is done on the results of integer procedures, but 
not on real procedures (in the current REDUCE release). &lt;identifier&gt; 
may be any valid REDUCE identifier that is not already a procedure name, 
operator, 
<A HREF=r37_0188.html>array</A> or 
<A HREF=r37_0345.html>matrix</A>. 
&lt;arg&gt; is a formal parameter that may be any 
valid REDUCE identifier. &lt;body&gt; is a single statement (a 
<A HREF=r37_0038.html>group</A> 
or 
<A HREF=r37_0041.html>block</A> statement may be used) with the desired activiti
es in it.

</TT></PRE><P>Procedures are automatically declared as operators upon definition
. When 
REDUCE has parsed the procedure definition and successfully converted it to 
a form for its own use, it prints the name of the procedure. Procedure 
definitions cannot be nested. Procedures can call other procedures, or can 
recursively call themselves. Procedure identifiers can be cleared as you 
would clear an operator. Unlike 
<A HREF=r37_0199.html>let</A> statements, new definitions 
under the same procedure name replace the previous definitions completely. 
<P>
<P>
Be careful not to use the name of a system operator for your own procedure. 
REDUCE may or may not give you a warning message. If you redefine a system 
operator in your own procedure, the original function of the system operator 
is lost for the remainder of the REDUCE session. 
<P>
<P>
Procedures may have none, one, or more than one parameter. A REDUCE 
parameter is a formal parameter only; the use of x as a parameter in 
a <em>procedure</em> definition has no connection with a value of x in 
the REDUCE session, and the results of calling a procedure have no effect 
on the value of x. If a procedure is called with x as a 
parameter, the current value of x is used as specified in the 
computation, but is not changed outside the procedure. 
Making an assignment statement by <em>:=</em> with a 
formal parameter on the left-hand side only changes the value of the 
calling parameter within the procedure. 
<P>
<P>
Using a 
<A HREF=r37_0199.html>let</A> statement inside a procedure always changes the va
lue 
globally: a <em>let</em> with a formal parameter makes the change to the calling
 
parameter. <em>let</em> statements cannot be made on local variables inside 

<A HREF=r37_0040.html>begin</A>...<em>end</em> 
<A HREF=r37_0041.html>block</A><em>s</em>. 
When 
<A HREF=r37_0189.html>clear</A> statements are used on formal 
parameters, the calling variables associated with them are cleared globally too.
 
The use of <em>let</em> or <em>clear</em> statements inside procedures 
should be done with extreme caution. 
<P>
<P>
Arrays and operators may be used as parameters to procedures. The body of the 
procedure can contain statements that appropriately manipulate these 
arguments. Changes are made to values of the calling arrays or operators. 
Simple expressions can also be used as arguments, in the place of scalar 
variables. Matrices may not be used as arguments to procedures. 
<P>
<P>
A procedure that has no parameters is called by the procedure name, 
immediately followed by empty parentheses. The empty parentheses may be left 
out when writing a procedure with no parameters, but must appear in a call of 
the procedure. If this is a nuisance to you, use a 
<A HREF=r37_0199.html>let</A> statement on 
the name of the procedure (i.e., <em>let noargs = noargs()</em>) after which 
you can call the procedure by just its name. 
<P>
<P>
Procedures that have a single argument can leave out the parentheses around 
it both in the definition and procedure call. (You can use the parentheses if 
you wish.) Procedures with more than one argument must use parentheses, with 
the arguments separated by commas. 
<P>
<P>
Procedures often have a <em>begin</em>...<em>end</em> block in them. Inside the 

block, local variables are declared using <em>scalar</em>, <em>real</em> or 
<em>integer</em> declarations. 
The declarations must be made immediately after the word 
<em>begin</em>, and if more than one type of declaration is made, they are 
separated by semicolons. REDUCE currently does no type checking on local 
variables; <em>real</em> and <em>integer</em> are treated just like <em>scalar
</em>. 
Actions take place as specified in the statements inside the block statement. 
Any identifiers that are not formal parameters or local variables are treated 
as global variables, and activities involving these identifiers are global in 
effect. 
<P>
<P>
If a return value is desired from a procedure call, a specific 

<A HREF=r37_0058.html>return</A> command must be the last statement executed bef
ore exiting 
from the procedure. If no <em>return</em> is used, a procedure returns a 
zero or no value. 
<P>
<P>
Procedures are often written in a file using an editor, then the file 
is input using the command 
<A HREF=r37_0231.html>in</A>. This method allows easy changes in 
development, and also allows you to load the named procedures whenever 
you like, by loading the files that contain them.
