<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>procedure</em> command allows you to define a mathematical operation
  as a function with arguments.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
  _ _ _ &lt;option&gt; <em>procedure</em> &lt;identifier&gt;
  (&lt;arg&gt;{,&lt;arg&gt;}+)<em>;</em>&lt;body&gt;
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  The &lt;option&gt; may be
  <a href="r37_0186.html">algebraic</a> or <a href="r37_0221.html">symbolic</a>,
  indicating the mode under which the procedure is executed, or
  <a href="r37_0216.html">real</a> or

  <a href="r37_0197.html">integer</a>, indicating the type of answer expected.
  The d efault is algebraic. Real or integer procedures are subtypes of
  algebraic procedures; type-checking is done on the results of integer
  procedures, but not on real procedures (in the current REDUCE release).
  &lt;identifier&gt; may be any valid REDUCE identifier that is not already a
  procedure name, operator, <a href="r37_0188.html">array</a> or
  <a href="r37_0345.html">matrix</a>. &lt;arg&gt; is a formal parameter that may
  be any valid REDUCE identifier. &lt;body&gt; is a single statement (a
  <a href="r37_0038.html">group</a>
  or
  <a href="r37_0041.html">block</a> statement may be used) with the desired
  activiti es in it.

<p>
  Procedures are automatically declared as operators upon definition . When
  REDUCE has parsed the procedure definition and successfully converted it to a
  form for its own use, it prints the name of the procedure. Procedure
  definitions cannot be nested. Procedures can call other procedures, or can
  recursively call themselves. Procedure identifiers can be cleared as you would
  clear an operator. Unlike <a href="r37_0199.html">let</a> statements, new
  definitions under the same procedure name replace the previous definitions
  completely.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Be careful not to use the name of a system operator for your own procedure.
  REDUCE may or may not give you a warning message. If you redefine a system
  operator in your own procedure, the original function of the system operator
  is lost for the remainder of the REDUCE session.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Procedures may have none, one, or more than one parameter. A REDUCE parameter
  is a formal parameter only; the use of x as a parameter in a
  <em>procedure</em> definition has no connection with a value of x in the
  REDUCE session, and the results of calling a procedure have no effect on the
  value of x. If a procedure is called with x as a parameter, the current value
  of x is used as specified in the computation, but is not changed outside the
  procedure. Making an assignment statement by <em>:=</em> with a formal
  parameter on the left-hand side only changes the value of the calling
  parameter within the procedure.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Using a
  <a href="r37_0199.html">let</a> statement inside a procedure always changes
  the va lue globally: a <em>let</em> with a formal parameter makes the change
  to the calling parameter. <em>let</em> statements cannot be made on local
  variables inside

  <a href="r37_0040.html">begin</a>...<em>end</em>
  <a href="r37_0041.html">block</a><em>s</em>. When
  <a href="r37_0189.html">clear</a> statements are used on formal parameters,
  the calling variables associated with them are cleared globally too. The use
  of <em>let</em> or <em>clear</em> statements inside procedures should be done
  with extreme caution.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Arrays and operators may be used as parameters to procedures. The body of the
  procedure can contain statements that appropriately manipulate these
  arguments. Changes are made to values of the calling arrays or operators.
  Simple expressions can also be used as arguments, in the place of scalar
  variables. Matrices may not be used as arguments to procedures.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  A procedure that has no parameters is called by the procedure name,
  immediately followed by empty parentheses. The empty parentheses may be left
  out when writing a procedure with no parameters, but must appear in a call of
  the procedure. If this is a nuisance to you, use a
  <a href="r37_0199.html">let</a> statement on the name of the procedure (i.e.,
  <em>let noargs = noargs()</em>) after which you can call the procedure by just
  its name.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Procedures that have a single argument can leave out the parentheses around it
  both in the definition and procedure call. (You can use the parentheses if you
  wish.) Procedures with more than one argument must use parentheses, with the
  arguments separated by commas.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Procedures often have a <em>begin</em>...<em>end</em> block in them. Inside
  the block, local variables are declared using <em>scalar</em>,
  <em>real</em> or <em>integer</em> declarations. The declarations must be made
  immediately after the word <em>begin</em>, and if more than one type of
  declaration is made, they are separated by semicolons. REDUCE currently does
  no type checking on local variables; <em>real</em> and <em>integer</em> are
  treated just like <em>scalar </em>. Actions take place as specified in the
  statements inside the block statement. Any identifiers that are not formal
  parameters or local variables are treated as global variables, and activities
  involving these identifiers are global in effect.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  If a return value is desired from a procedure call, a specific

  <a href="r37_0058.html">return</a> command must be the last statement executed
  bef ore exiting from the procedure. If no <em>return</em> is used, a procedure
  returns a zero or no value.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Procedures are often written in a file using an editor, then the file is input
  using the command
  <a href="r37_0231.html">in</a>. This method allows easy changes in
  development, and also allows you to load the named procedures whenever you
  like, by loading the files that contain them.
