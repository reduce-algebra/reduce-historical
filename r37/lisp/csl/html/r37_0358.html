The terms are ordered first with their total

the comparison is the inverse of 
<A HREF=r37_0356.html>lex term order</A>. 
With 
<A HREF=r37_0368.html>groebner</A> and 
<A HREF=r37_0390.html>groebnerf</A> 
calculations this term order 
is similar to 
<A HREF=r37_0357.html>gradlex term order</A>; it is known 
as most efficient ordering with respect to computing time.
