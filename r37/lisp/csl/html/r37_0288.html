When the <em>failhard</em> switch is on, the integration operator 
<A HREF=r37_0154.html>int</A> 
terminates with an error message if the integral cannot be done in closed 
terms. 
Default is off. 
<P>
<P>
Use the <em>failhard</em> switch when you are dealing with complicated integrals
 
and want to know immediately if REDUCE was unable to handle them. The 
integration operator sometimes returns a formal integration form that is 
more complicated than the original expression, when it is unable to 
complete the integration.
