<p>
  When the <em>failhard</em> switch is on, the integration operator
  <a href="r37_0154.html">int</a>
  terminates with an error message if the integral cannot be done in closed
  terms. Default is off.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Use the <em>failhard</em> switch when you are dealing with complicated
  integrals and want to know immediately if REDUCE was unable to handle them.
  The integration operator sometimes returns a formal integration form that is
  more complicated than the original expression, when it is unable to complete
  the integration.
