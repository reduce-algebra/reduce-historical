This package provides REDUCE with the ability to perform vector algebra 
using the same notation as scalar algebra. The basic algebraic operations 
are supported, as are differentiation and integration of vectors with 
respect to scalar variables, cross product and dot product, component 
manipulation and application of scalar functions (e.g. cosine) to a vector 
to yield a vector result.
