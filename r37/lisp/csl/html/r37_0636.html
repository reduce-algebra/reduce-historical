  This package provides REDUCE with the ability to perform vector algebra using
  the same notation as scalar algebra. The basic algebraic operations are
  supported, as are differentiation and integration of vectors with respect to
  scalar variables, cross product and dot product, component manipulation and
  application of scalar functions (e.g. cosine) to a vector to yield a vector
  result.
