<p>
  The operator <em>part</em> permits the extraction of various parts or
  operators of expressions and <a href="r37_0053.html">list</a><em>s</em>.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><em>part</em>(&lt;expression,integer&gt;{,&lt;integer&gt;}*)</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;expression&gt; can be any valid REDUCE expression or a list, integer may
  be an expression that evaluates to a positive or negative integer or 0. A
  positive integer &lt;n&gt; picks up the n th term, counting from the first
  term toward the end. A negative integer n picks up the n th term, counting
  from the back toward the front. The integer 0 picks up the operator (which is
  <em>LIST</em> when the expression is a <a href="r37_0053.html">list</a>).

<p>
  Additional integer arguments after the first one examine the terms
  recursively, as shown above. In the third line, the fourth term is picked from
  the original polynomial, 10x^2y^3, then the second term from that, x^2, and
  finally the first component, x. If an integer's absolute value is too large
  for the appropriate expression, a message is given.

  <em>part</em>works on the form of the expression as printed, or as it would
  have been printed at that point of the calculation, bearing in mind the
  current switch settings. It is important to realize that the switch settings
  change the operation of <em>part</em>. <a href="r37_0319.html">pri</a> must be
  on when <em>part</em> is used.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  When <em>part</em> is used on a polynomial expression that has minus signs,
  the

  <em>+</em> is always returned as the top-level operator. The minus is found as
  a unary operator attached to the negative term.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  <em>part</em>can also be used to change the relevant part of the expression or
  list as shown in the sixth example line. The <em>part</em> operator returns
  the changed expression, though original expression is not changed. You can
  also use <em>part</em> to change the operator.
