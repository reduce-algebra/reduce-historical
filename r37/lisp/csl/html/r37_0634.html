This package provides facilities for handling algebraic numbers as polynomial 
coefficients in REDUCE calculations. It includes facilities for introducing 
indeterminates to represent algebraic numbers, for calculating splitting 
fields, and for factoring and finding greatest common divisors in such 
domains.
