The <em>pause</em> command, given in an interactive file, stops operation and 
asks if you want to continue or not.

To use <em>pause</em> in your own interactive files, type 
<P>
<P>
<em>pause;</em>in the file wherever you want it. 
<P>
<P>
<em>pause</em>does not allow you to continue without typing either <em>y</em> 
or <em>n</em>. Its use is to slow down scrolling of interactive files, or to 
let you change parameters or switch settings for the calculations. 
<P>
<P>
If you have stopped an interactive file at a <em>pause,</em> and do not wish to 

resume the file, type <em>end;</em>. This does not end the REDUCE session, but 
stops input from the file. A second <em>end;</em> ends the REDUCE session. 
However, if you have pauses from more than one file stacked up, an <em>end;</em>
 
brings you back to the top level, not the file directly above. 
<P>
<P>
A <em>pause</em> typed from the terminal has no effect.
