A <em>kernel</em> is a form that cannot be modified further by the REDUCE 
canonical simplifier. Scalar variables are always kernels. The 
other important class of kernels are operators with their arguments. 
Some examples should help clarify this concept:

</TT></PRE><P>Many REDUCE operators expect kernels among their arguments. Error 
messages 
result from attempts to use non-kernel expressions for these arguments.
