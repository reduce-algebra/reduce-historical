This package has been designed to meet the requirements of theoretical 
physicists looking for a computer algebra tool to perform complicated 
calculations in quantum theory with expressions containing operators. 
These operations consist mainly of the calculation of commutators between 
operator expressions and in the evaluations of operator matrix elements in 
some abstract space.
