  This package has been designed to meet the requirements of theoretical
  physicists looking for a computer algebra tool to perform complicated
  calculations in quantum theory with expressions containing operators. These
  operations consist mainly of the calculation of commutators between operator
  expressions and in the evaluations of operator matrix elements in some
  abstract space.
