When <em>comp</em> is on, any succeeding function definitions are compiled 
into a faster-running form. Default is <em>off</em>.

Note that the compiled procedure runs faster. Your time messages will 
differ depending upon which system you have. Compiled functions remain so 
for the duration of the REDUCE session, and are then lost. They must be 
recompiled if wanted in another session. With the switch 
<A HREF=r37_0333.html>time</A> on 
as shown above, the CPU time used in executing the command is returned in 
milliseconds. Be careful not to leave <em>comp</em> on unless you want it, 
as it makes the processing of procedures much slower.
