<P>
The terms are ordered lexicographically: two terms t1 t2 
are compared for their degrees 
along the fixed variable sequence: t1 is higher than t2 
if the first different degree is higher in t1. 
This order has the <em>elimination property</em> 
for <em>groebner basis</em> calculations. 
If the ideal has a univariate polynomial in the last 
variable the groebner basis will contain 
such polynomial. <em>Lex</em> is best 
suited for solving of polynomial equation systems.
