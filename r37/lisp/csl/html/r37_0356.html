  <b>LEX TERM ORDER</b>

  The terms are ordered lexicographically: two terms t1 t2 are compared for
  their degrees along the fixed variable sequence: t1 is higher than t2 if the
  first different degree is higher in t1. This order has the
  <em>elimination property</em> for <em>groebner basis</em> calculations. If the
  ideal has a univariate polynomial in the last variable the groebner basis will
  contain such polynomial. <em>Lex</em> is best suited for solving of polynomial
  equation systems.
