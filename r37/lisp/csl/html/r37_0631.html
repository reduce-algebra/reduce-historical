REDUCE includes a large number of packages that have been contributed by 
users from various fields. Some of these, together with their relevant 
commands, switches and so on (e.g., the NUMERIC package), have 
been described elsewhere. This section describes those packages for which 
no separate help material exists. Each has its own switches, commands, 
and operators, and some redefine special characters to aid in their 
notation. However, the brief descriptions given here do not include all 
such information. Readers are referred to the general package 
documentation in this case, which can be found, along with the source 
code, under the subdirectories <em>doc</em> and <em>src</em> in the 
<em>reduce</em> directory. The 
<A HREF=r37_0127.html>load_package</A> command is used to 
load the files you wish into your system. There will be a short delay 
while the package is loaded. A package cannot be unloaded. Once it 
is in your system, it stays there until you end the session. Each package 
also has a test file, which you will find under its name in the 
<em>$reduce/xmpl</em> directory.

Finally, it should be mentioned that such user-contributed packages are 
unsupported; any questions or problems should be directed to their 
authors.
