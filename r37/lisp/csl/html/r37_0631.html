<p>
  REDUCE includes a large number of packages that have been contributed by users
  from various fields. Some of these, together with their relevant commands,
  switches and so on (e.g., the NUMERIC package), have been described elsewhere.
  This section describes those packages for which no separate help material
  exists. Each has its own switches, commands, and operators, and some redefine
  special characters to aid in their notation. However, the brief descriptions
  given here do not include all such information. Readers are referred to the
  general package documentation in this case, which can be found, along with the
  source code, under the subdirectories <em>doc</em> and <em>src</em> in the
  <em>reduce</em> directory. The
  <a href="r37_0127.html">load_package</a> command is used to load the files you
  wish into your system. There will be a short delay while the package is
  loaded. A package cannot be unloaded. Once it is in your system, it stays
  there until you end the session. Each package also has a test file, which you
  will find under its name in the <em>$reduce/xmpl</em> directory.

  Finally, it should be mentioned that such user-contributed packages are
  unsupported; any questions or problems should be directed to their authors.
