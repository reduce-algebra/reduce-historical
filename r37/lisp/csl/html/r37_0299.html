  The <em>lcm</em> switch instructs REDUCE to compute the least common multiple
  of denominators whenever rational expressions occur. Default is <em>on</em>.

<p>
  Note that <em>lcm</em> has effect only when rational expressions a re first
  combined. It does not examine existing structures for simplifications on
  display. That is shown above when z is entered with <em>lcm</em> off. It
  remains unsimplified even after <em>lcm</em> is turned back on. However, a new
  variable containing the same expression is simplified on entry. The switch
  <a href="r37_0086.html">gcd</a> does examine existing structures, as shown in
  the last example line above.
</p>

<p>
  Full greatest common divisor calculations become expensive if work with large
  rational expressions is required. A considerable savings of time can be had if
  a full gcd check is made only when denominators are combined, and only a
  partial check for numerators. This is the effect of the <em>lcm</em>

  switch.
