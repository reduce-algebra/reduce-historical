The <em>lcm</em> switch instructs REDUCE to compute the least common multiple 
of denominators whenever rational expressions occur. Default is <em>on</em>.

</TT></PRE><P>Note that <em>lcm</em> has effect only when rational expressions a
re first 
combined. It does not examine existing structures for simplifications on 
display. That is shown above when z is entered with 
<em>lcm</em> off. It remains unsimplified even after <em>lcm</em> is turned 
back on. However, a new variable containing the same expression is 
simplified on entry. The switch 
<A HREF=r37_0086.html>gcd</A> does examine existing 
structures, as shown in the last example line above.

Full greatest common divisor calculations become expensive if work with 
large rational expressions is required. A considerable savings of time 
can be had if a full gcd check is made only when denominators are combined, 
and only a partial check for numerators. This is the effect of the <em>lcm</em> 

switch.
