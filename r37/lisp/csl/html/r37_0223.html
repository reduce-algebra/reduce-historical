<p></p>
<p>
  The <em>tr</em> declaration is used to trace system or user-written
  procedures. It is only useful to those with a good knowledge of both Lisp and
  the internal formats used by REDUCE.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>syntax:</h3>
<em>tr</em>&lt;name&gt;{,&lt;name&gt;}*
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;name&gt; is the name of a REDUCE system procedure or one of your own
  procedures.
</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>examples:</h3>
<p></p>
<pre><TT></TT></pre>
<p>
  The system procedure <em>prepsq</em> is traced, which prepares REDUCE standard
  forms for printing by converting them to a Lisp prefix form.
</p>

<p></p>
<pre><TT>

tr prepsq;

  (PREPSQ)


x**2 + y;

  PREPSQ entry:
    Arg 1: (((((X . 2) . 1) ((Y . 1) . 1)) . 1)
  PREPSQ return value = (PLUS (EXPT X 2) Y)
  PREPSQ entry:
    Arg 1: (1 . 1)
  PREPSQ return value = 1
   2
  X  + Y


untr prepsq;

  (PREPSQ)

</TT></PRE>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  This example is for a PSL-based system; the above format will vary if other
  Lisp systems are used.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  When a procedure is traced, the first lines show entry to the procedure and
  the arguments it is given. The value returned by the procedure is printed upon
  exit. If you are tracing several procedures, with a call to one of them inside
  the other, the inner trace will be indented showing procedure nesting. There
  are no trace options. However, the format of the trace depends on the
  underlying Lisp system used. The trace can be removed with the command
  <a href="r37_0224.html">untr</a>. Note that <em>trace</em>, below, is a matrix
  operator, while <em>tr</em> does procedure tracing.
