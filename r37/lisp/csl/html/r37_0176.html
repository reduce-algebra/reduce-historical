  When the operator
  <a href="r37_0179.html">solve</a> is unable to find an explicit solution or if
  that solution would be too complicated, the result is presented as formal root
  expression using the internal operator <em>root_of</em> and a new local
  variable. An expression with a top level <em>root_of</em> is implicitly a list
  with an unknown number of elements since we can't always know how many
  solutions an equation has. If a substitution is made into such an expression,
  closed form solutions can emerge. If this occurs, the
  <em>root_of</em> construct is replaced by an operator
  <a href="r37_0168.html">one_of</a>. At this point it is of course possible to
  transform the result if the original <em>solve</em> operator expression into a
  standard <em>solve</em> solution. To effect this, the operator
  <a href="r37_0149.html">expand_cases</a> can be used.

<h3>examples:</h3>

<pre><TT>
solve(a*x^7-x^2+1,x);

                 7     2
  {x=root_of(a*x_  - x_  + 1,x_)}


sub(a=0,ws);

  {x=one_of(1,-1)}


expand_cases ws;

  x=1,x=-1

</TT></PRE>
<p>
  The components of <em>root_of</em> and <em>one_of</em> expressions can be
  processed as usual with operators <a href="r37_0140.html">arglength</a> and
  <a href="r37_0169.html">part</a>. A higher power of a
  <em>root_of</em> expression with a polynomial as first argument is simplified
  by using the polynomial as a side relation.
