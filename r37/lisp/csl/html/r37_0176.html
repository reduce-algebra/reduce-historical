When the operator 
<A HREF=r37_0179.html>solve</A> is unable to find an explicit solution 
or if that solution would be too complicated, the result is presented 
as formal root expression using the internal operator <em>root_of</em> 
and a new local variable. An expression with a top level <em>root_of</em> 
is implicitly a list with an unknown number of elements since we 
can't always know how many solutions an equation has. If a 
substitution is made into such an expression, closed form solutions 
can emerge. If this occurs, the <em>root_of</em> construct is 
replaced by an operator 
<A HREF=r37_0168.html>one_of</A>. At this point it is 
of course possible to transform the result if the original <em>solve</em> 
operator expression into a standard <em>solve</em> solution. To 
effect this, the operator 
<A HREF=r37_0149.html>expand_cases</A> can be used.

</TT></PRE><P>The components of <em>root_of</em> and <em>one_of</em> expressions
 can be 
processed as usual with operators 
<A HREF=r37_0140.html>arglength</A> and 
<A HREF=r37_0169.html>part</A>. 
A higher power of a <em>root_of</em> expression with a polynomial 
as first argument is simplified by using the polynomial as a side relation.
