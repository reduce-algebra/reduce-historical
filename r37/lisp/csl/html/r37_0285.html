  In many cases it is desirable to expand product arguments of logarithms, or
  collect a sum of logarithms into a single logarithm. Since these are inverse
  operations, it is not possible to provide rules for doing both at the same
  time and preserve the REDUCE concept of idempotent evaluation. As an
  alternative, REDUCE provides two switches <em>expandlogs</em> and

  <a href="r37_0272.html">combinelogs</a> to carry out these operations. Both
  are of f by default.

  LOG(X) + LOG(Y)

  LOG(X*Y)

  At the present time, it is possible to have both switches on at once, which
  could lead to infinite recursion. However, an expression is switched from one
  form to the other in this case. Users should not rely on this behavior, since
  it may change in the next release.
