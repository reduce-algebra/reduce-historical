When <em>trnonlnr</em> is on, a narrative tracing various steps in 
the process for solving non-linear equations is produced. 
<P>
<P>
<em>trnonlnr</em>can only be used after the solve package has been loaded 
(e.g., by an explicit call of 
<A HREF=r37_0127.html>load_package</A>). The 
<A HREF=r37_0233.html>out</A> 
command saves the results of the equation solving, but not the trace.
