When <em>fort</em> is on, output is given Fortran-compatible syntax. Default 
is <em>off</em>.

</TT></PRE><P>REDUCE results can be written to a file (using 
<A HREF=r37_0233.html>out</A>) and used as data 
by Fortran programs when <em>fort</em> is in effect. <em>fort</em> knows about 
correct statement length, continuation characters, defining a symbol when 
it is first used, and other Fortran details.

The 
<A HREF=r37_0651.html>GENTRAN</A> package offers many more possibilities than th
e 
<em>fort</em> switch. It produces Fortran (or C or Ratfor) code from REDUCE 
procedures or structured specifications, including facilities for producing 
double precision output.
