The numeric package supplies algorithms based on approximation 
techniques of numerical mathematics. The algorithms use 
the 
<A HREF=r37_0330.html>rounded</A> mode arithmetic of REDUCE, including 
the variable precision feature which is exploited in some 
algorithms in an adaptive manner in order to reach the 
desired accuracy.
