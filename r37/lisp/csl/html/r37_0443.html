</p>

<p>
  The REDUCE <em>Special Function Package</em> supplies extended algebraic and
  numeric support for a wide class of objects. This package was released
  together with REDUCE 3.5 (October 1993) for the first time, a major update is
  released with REDUCE 3.6.
</p>

<p>
  The functions included in this package are in most cases (unless otherwise
  stated) defined and named like in the book by Abramowitz and Stegun: Handbook
  of Mathematical Functions, Dover Publications.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The aim is to collect as much information on the special functions and
  simplification capabilities as possible, i.e. algebraic simplifications and
  numeric (rounded mode) code, limits of the functions together with the
  definitions of the functions, which are in most cases a power series, a
  (definite) integral and/or a differential equation.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  What can be found: Some famous constants, a variety of Bessel functions,
  special polynomials, the Gamma function, the (Riemann) Zeta function, Elliptic
  Functions, Elliptic Integrals, 3J symbols (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients) and
  integral functions.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  What is missing: Mathieu functions, LerchPhi, etc.. The information about the
  special functions which solve certain differential equation is very limited.
  In several cases numerical approximation is restricted to real arguments or is
  missing completely.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The implementation of this package uses REDUCE rule sets to a large extent,
  which guarantees a high 'readability' of the functions definitions in the
  source file directory. It makes extensions to the special functions code easy
  in most cases too. To look at these rules it may be convenient to use the
  showrules operator e.g.
</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="r37_0178.html">showrules</a>Besseli;</p>

<p></p>
<p>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Some evaluations are improved if the special function package is loaded, e.g.
  some (infinite) sums and products leading to expressions including special
  functions are known in this case.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>Note: The special function package has to be loaded explicitly by calling</p>

<p></p>
<pre><TT>
   load_package specfn;
</TT></PRE>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  The functions
  <a href="r37_0529.html">MeijerG</a> and
  <a href="r37_0528.html">hypergeometric</a> require additionally
