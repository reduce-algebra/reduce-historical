  When <em>time</em> is on, the system time used in executing each REDUCE
  statement is printed after the answer is printed.

<h3>examples:</h3>

<pre><TT>
on time; 

  Time: 4940 ms 


df(sin(x**2 + y),y); 

            2
  COS(X  + Y )
  Time: 180 ms


solve(x**2 - 6*y,x); 

  {X= - SQRT(Y)*SQRT(6),
   X=SQRT(Y)*SQRT(6)}
  Time: 320 ms

</TT></PRE>
<p>
  When <em>time</em> is first turned on, the time since the beginnin g of the
  REDUCE session is printed. After that, the time used in computation, (usually
  in milliseconds, though this is system dependent) is printed after the results
  of each command. Idle time or time spent typing in commands is not counted. If
  <em>time</em> is turned off, the first reading after it is turned on again
  gives the time elapsed since it was turned off. The time printed is CPU or
  wall clock time, depending on the system.
