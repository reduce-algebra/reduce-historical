When <em>time</em> is on, the system time used in executing each REDUCE 
statement is printed after the answer is printed.

</TT></PRE><P>When <em>time</em> is first turned on, the time since the beginnin
g of the 
REDUCE session is printed. After that, the time used in computation, 
(usually in milliseconds, though this is system dependent) is printed after 
the results of each command. Idle time or time spent typing in commands is 
not counted. If <em>time</em> is turned off, the first reading after it is 
turned on again gives the time elapsed since it was turned off. The time 
printed is CPU or wall clock time, depending on the system.
