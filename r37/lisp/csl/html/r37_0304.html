  When <em>mcd</em> is on, sums and differences of rational expressions are put
  on a common denominator. Default is <em>on</em>.

<h3>examples:</h3>

<pre><TT>
a/(x+1) + b/5; 

  5*A + B*X + B
  ------------- 
    5*(X + 1)


off mcd; 

a/(x+1) + b/5; 

         -1
  (X + 1)  *A + 1/5*B 


1/6 + 1/7; 

  13/42

<p>
  Even with <em>mcd</em> off, rational expressions involving only nu mbers are
  still put over a common denominator.
</p>

<p>
  Turning <em>mcd</em> off is useful when explicit negative powers are needed,
  or if no greatest common divisor calculations are desired, or when
  differentiating complicated rational expressions. Results when <em>mcd</em> is
  off are no longer in canonical form, and expressions equivalent to zero may
  not simplify to 0. Some operations, such as factoring cannot be done while
  <em>mcd</em> is off. This option should therefore be used with some caution.
  Turning <em>mcd</em> off is most valuable in intermediate parts of a
  complicated calculation, and should be turned back on for the last stage.
