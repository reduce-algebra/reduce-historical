When <em>mcd</em> is on, sums and differences of rational expressions are put 
on a common denominator. Default is <em>on</em>.

Turning <em>mcd</em> off is useful when explicit negative powers are needed, 
or if no greatest common divisor calculations are desired, or when 
differentiating complicated rational expressions. Results when <em>mcd</em> 
is off are no longer in canonical form, and expressions equivalent to zero 
may not simplify to 0. Some operations, such as factoring cannot be done 
while <em>mcd</em> is off. This option should therefore be used with some 
caution. Turning <em>mcd</em> off is most valuable in intermediate parts of 
a complicated calculation, and should be turned back on for the last stage.
