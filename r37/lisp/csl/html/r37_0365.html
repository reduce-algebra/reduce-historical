  <b>MATRIX TERM ORDER</b>

<p>
  Any arbitrary term order mode can be installed by a matrix with integer
  elements where the row length corresponds to the variable number. The matrix
  must have at least as many rows as columns. It must have full rank, and the
  top nonzero element of each column must be positive.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The matrix <em>term order mode</em> defines a term order where the exponent
  vectors of the monomials are first multiplied by the matrix and the resulting
  vectors are compared lexicographically.

<p>
  If the switch
  <a href="r37_0273.html">comp</a> is on, the matrix is converted into a
  compiled LISP program for faster execution. A matrix can also be compiled
  explicitly, see <a href="r37_0355.html">torder_compile</a>.
