Any arbitrary term order mode can be installed by a matrix with 
integer elements where the row length corresponds to the variable 
number. The matrix must have at least as many rows as columns. 
It must have full rank, and the top nonzero element of each column 
must be positive.

<P>
The matrix <em>term order mode</em> 
defines a term order where the exponent vectors of the monomials are 
first multiplied by the matrix and the resulting vectors are compared 
lexicographically.

If the switch 
<A HREF=r37_0273.html>comp</A> is on, the matrix is converted into 
a compiled LISP program for faster execution. A matrix can also be 
compiled explicitly, see 
<A HREF=r37_0355.html>torder_compile</A>.
