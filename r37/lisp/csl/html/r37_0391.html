The variable <em>groebmonfac</em> is connected to 
the handling of monomial factors. A monomial factor is a product 
of variable powers as a factor, e.g. x**2*y in x**3*y - 
2*x**2*y**2. A monomial factor represents a solution of the type 
 x = 0 or y = 0 with a certain multiplicity. With 

<A HREF=r37_0390.html>groebnerf</A> the multiplicity of monomial factors is lowe
red 
to the value of the shared variable <em>groebmonfac</em> 
which by default is 1 (= monomial factors remain present, but their 
multiplicity is brought down). With 
<em>groebmonfac</em>:= 0 
the monomial factors are suppressed completely.
