<p>
  The variable <em>groebmonfac</em> is connected to the handling of monomial
  factors. A monomial factor is a product of variable powers as a factor, e.g.
  x**2*y in x**3*y - 2*x**2*y**2. A monomial factor represents a solution of the
  type x = 0 or y = 0 with a certain multiplicity. With

  <a href="r37_0390.html">groebnerf</a> the multiplicity of monomial factors is
  lowe red to the value of the shared variable <em>groebmonfac</em>
  which by default is 1 (= monomial factors remain present, but their
  multiplicity is brought down). With
  <em>groebmonfac</em>:= 0 the monomial factors are suppressed completely.
