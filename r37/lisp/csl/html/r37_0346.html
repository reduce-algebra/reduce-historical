<em>nullspace</em>(&lt;matrix\_expression&gt;) 
<P>
<P>
<P>
&lt;nullspace&gt; calculates for its 
<A HREF=r37_0345.html>matrix</A> argument, 
<em>a</em>, a list of 
linear independent vectors (a basis) whose linear combinations satisfy the 
equation a x = 0. The basis is provided in a form such that as many 
upper components as possible are isolated.

</TT></PRE><P>Note that with <em>b := nullspace a</em>, the expression <em>lengt
h b</em> is 
the nullity/ of A, and that <em>second length a - length b</em> 
calculates the rank/ of A. The rank of a matrix expression can 
also be found more directly by the 
<A HREF=r37_0347.html>rank</A> operator.

<P>
In addition to the REDUCE matrix form, <em>nullspace</em> accepts as input a 
matrix given as a 
<A HREF=r37_0053.html>list</A> of lists, that is interpreted as a row matrix. If
 
that form of input is chosen, the vectors in the result will be 
represented by lists as well. This additional input syntax facilitates 
the use of <em>nullspace</em> in applications different from classical linear 
algebra.
