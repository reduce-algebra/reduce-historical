<h3>syntax:</h3>
<em>nullspace</em>(&lt;matrix\_expression&gt;)
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
  &lt;nullspace&gt; calculates for its
  <a href="r37_0345.html">matrix</a> argument, <em>a</em>, a list of linear
  independent vectors (a basis) whose linear combinations satisfy the equation a
  x = 0. The basis is provided in a form such that as many upper components as
  possible are isolated.

nullspace mat((1,2,3,4),(5,6,7,8)); 


         {
           [ 1  ]
           [    ]
           [ 0  ]
           [    ]
           [ - 3]
           [    ]
           [ 2  ]
           ,
           [ 0  ]
           [    ]
           [ 1  ]
           [    ]
           [ - 2]
           [    ]
           [ 1  ]
          }

</TT></PRE>
<p>
  Note that with <em>b := nullspace a</em>, the expression <em>lengt h b</em> is
  the nullity/ of A, and that <em>second length a - length b</em>
  calculates the rank/ of A. The rank of a matrix expression can also be found
  more directly by the
  <a href="r37_0347.html">rank</a> operator.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the REDUCE matrix form, <em>nullspace</em> accepts as input a
  matrix given as a <a href="r37_0053.html">list</a> of lists, that is
  interpreted as a row matrix. If that form of input is chosen, the vectors in
  the result will be represented by lists as well. This additional input syntax
  facilitates the use of <em>nullspace</em> in applications different from
  classical linear algebra.
