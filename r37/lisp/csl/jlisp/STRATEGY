Strategy for preserving a heap image...


(a)

   S = HashTable()      // "stack" (maybe have one for cons, one for symbol
                        //          and one for vectors?)
   V = HashTable()      // "visited"
   V2 = HashTable()     // "visited twice"

   for each root, insert item into S, insert item into V

   while S is non-empty do
     p = an item removed from S
       for each x referred to be p
          [note: referred to may be modified for Cons cells to
                 iterate down lists here]
          if x is in V then
             if x is not in V2 then insert x into V2
          else 
            insert x into S and V
            

   [each item stored in V2 is <item, number> where the number is an index]
