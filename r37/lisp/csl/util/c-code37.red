% Here I need to consider the issue of patches.  First consider patches that
% had been in force when "profile.red" was run. In such cases a patched
% function f1 has an associated replacement f1_123456789 (the numeric suffix
% is a checksum on the new definition) and when the profile job was run
% this replacement will have had its definition copied to f1. The way in
% which CSL's mapstore function extracts counts will mean that the
% thing in profile.dat relate to f1_123456789.
% Usually things in profile.dat are in the form
%    (function_name . checksum_of_definition)
% but for these patched things I will instead record
%    (original_function_name package_involved)
% This can be distinguished because it has a symbol not a number as
% the second component. To make this possible each patch function
% f1_123456789 would have to have this information attached to it
% when the profiling job was run.
%
% But I suppose have now obtained a newer version of the patches file. So
% now the correct patch for f1 will be f1_abcdef. If f1 was in one of the
% REDUCE core packages (eg "alg") then both the functions f1_123456789 and
% f1_abcdef will be in memory now, but it will be the latter that will
% have been copied to plain old f1.  In other cases f1_123456789 will now
% have been totally lost and the definition of f1_abcdef will be in the
% patches module.  Furthermore the new patches file may patch another
% function f2 that had not previously been subject to patching, but
% that had been selected for compilation into C. And in a truly bad
% case the complete REDUCE sources will contain several functions named
% f2 and of course the patches file identifies which one it is interested
% in by the name of the package it is in.
%
% The response to all this I will use here is intended to make life
% reasonably SIMPLE for me in a complicated situation. So I first
% collect the set of names that I think need compiling into C. Then I
% grab a list of the names of things defined in the current patches file.
% If a function in the paches file has a name similar enough (!) to one that
% I have already decided to compile into C then I will schedule it for
% compilation into C too.  Because of the hash suffix added to names in the
% patches file defining a C version having those things present in the Lisp
% kernel should never be a problem - after all the patches file itself is
% intended to be loaded all the time.  So the main down-side of this is
% that I will sometimes find that I have compiled into C either patch
% versions of a function when it was another version of that code that was
% time-critical or that I have compiled into C two generations of
% patch function. These waste opportunity and space by having some
% things compiled into C that might not really justify that, but this
% seems a modest cost.
