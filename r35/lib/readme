                               15 July 1993

The files in this directory comprise a library of contributions from many
REDUCE users.  The relevant members first appeared in the REDUCE Network
Library.  They are collected here as a service to REDUCE users, and no
responsibility can be taken regarding them.  In particular, any questions
about any of the files should be directed to the relevant author(s).

All code in this library has been tested with REDUCE 3.5, but may require
modifications to work in later releases.  Any updates will appear in later
releases of this library, or in the REDUCE Network Library.  For an
information about this library, send the message "help" to
reduce-netlib@rand.org, reduce-netlib@can.nl or redlib@elib.zib-berlin.de.

The Network Library is divided into sublibraries which have a particular
theme (such as "chemistry").  The sublibraries are then divided into
members, which are individual files with names of the form <name>.<type>.
This particular organization is not preserved here, since all members are
in a single directory.  The table of contents of the current library
organized in the original hierarchical manner is:
