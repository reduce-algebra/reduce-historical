This document describes operating procedures for running  REDUCE  specific  to
the  DECSYSTEM  20  series  of  computers.   It  supplements the REDUCE User's
Manual, describing features, extension and limitations specific to this imple-
mentation of REDUCE.

REDUCE under TOPS-20 for a DECSYSTEM 20 series computer is stored as  an  exe-
cutable  binary  disk file.  The name of the directory that contains this file
is identified in this document as "<reduce>" .  Other REDUCE related files are
also stored in this directory.

Unless <reduce> is equivalent to sys: at your site, your command files  should
be  modified  to  include  <reduce> in your sys: search path.  An entry of the
form:

    def sys: <reduce>,sys:

is sufficient.

To run REDUCE, you then type (in upper or lower case)

    reduce

REDUCE will respond with a banner line and then prompt for the first  line  of
input:

     reduce 3.0, 15-Apr-83 ...

     1:

You can now begin entering commands.

The LISP interpreter currently in use with this version of REDUCE  was  origi-
nally written for a TOPS-10 system. As a result, its file names follow TOPS-10
conventions. In particular, the name and extension fields can be a maximum  of
six  and  three  characters long respectively. As a result, the filenames that
appear in IN, OUT and SHUT statements must follow this  convention.  Directory
names can be of three forms:

   An identifier followed by a colon, e.g., reduce:.

   An identifier enclosed in angle brackets, e.g., <reduce>. (Normally only
      used with TOPS-20.)

   A project, programmer pair, enclosed in square brackets, e.g., [22,304].
      (Normally only used with TOPS-10.)

The first two styles of directory name must precede the  file  name,  and  the
third follow it, as in

     "reduce:reduce.tst"

     "<reduce>reduce.tst"
or
     "reduce.tst[22,304]".

As a test of the system, you should try

     in "<reduce>reduce.tst";

which will load the standard REDUCE test file.

New users of REDUCE are advised to process the seven REDUCE Lessons  that  are
available as <reduce>lessi.  For example, to run Lesson 1, you would say:

     in "<reduce>less1";


4.  _R_E_D_U_C_E__D_O_C_U_M_E_N_T_A_T_I_O_N

REDUCE documents are also kept in the <reduce> directory, with  the  extension
doc. These include:

     instal.doc      Installation instructions

     reduce.doc      REDUCE User's Manual

     tops20.doc      TOPS-20 specific operation notes (i.e., this document).

The TOPS-20 version of REDUCE provides a link to the line-oriented system edi-
tor "EDIT".  There are two commands provided in this regard.

     EDIT <id>[,<integer>[,<integer>]]

If <id> is a valid file name, then this command will invoke the editor on this
file.   If  the optional integer arguments are omitted, then you will be posi-
tioned at the first line in the file.  On exiting from the editor, you will be
returned to REDUCE.  If the second argument is used, you will be positioned at
that line in the file.  If the third argument  is  used,  that  page  will  be
referenced rather than the default page 1.  For example,

     EDIT "foo.bah",100;

will position the editor at line 100 on page 1 of the file "foo.bah".

If the second or optional third arguments are specified, on exiting  from  the
editor REDUCE will first load the command that starts at the line specified in
the EDIT command before returning control to the user.

If <id> is not a file name, but is the name of a function that has been loaded
by  the user from a file, then the editor will be positioned at the first line

of that function.

Thirdly, if <id> is the name of a function that has been defined at the termi-
nal,  EDIT  will edit that function by a call to EDITDEF. In other words, EDIT
and EDITDEF are equivalent in this case.

If none of these conditions is satisfied, EDIT will abort with the error  that
<id> is not defined.

There are two cautions to be observed  in  using  this  command  to  reference
files.  First, you must not renumber the file or save it without line numbers,
since REDUCE  depends  on  the  explicit  line  numbers  for  its  references.
Secondly,  if you do not position the editor at the beginning of a command for
the second use of EDIT, then an error will obviously occur when  REDUCE  tries
to read the expression. The same cautions apply to CMD defined below.

     CMD <id><integer>[,<integer>]

This command causes the command defined at the line  <integer1>  in  the  file
<id> to be loaded. <integer2> can be used to specify an optional page.

6.1  _O_b_j_e_c_t__s_i_z_e_s

The maximum string and identifier lengths are limited only by the  total  size
of  the  memory partition for the names of such objects in the underlying LISP
interpreter.  This is usually several thousand characters  long.  However,  we
recommend  that  such  names  be limited to twenty-four characters or less for
compatibility with other versions of REDUCE.

Floating point numbers are printed with eight digit precision in either  fixed
notation  or  in  a scientific notation with a two digit exponent depending on
the size of the number.

Arbitrary precision integer and real arithmetic is supported.

Times (as reported by ON TIME or SHOWTIME)  are  given  in  milliseconds,  and
measure execution time including garbage collection time.  They do not include
operating system overhead (e.g., swapping time).

6.2  _S_p_e_c_i_a_l__c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s__a_n_d__i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t_s

Lower case input is permitted.

The end-of-file character is <control>Z.

<del> deletes a single character from terminal  input,  <control>U  the  whole
line.

A command may be terminated by <escape> instead  of  $.  This  has  the  added
advantage  that a Return is then not needed to evaluate the line.  <escape> is
also used to terminate strings in the REDUCE interactive editor.

^ may be used instead of ** to represent exponentiation.

6.3  _M_e_m_o_r_y__R_e_q_u_i_r_e_m_e_n_t_s

The distributed version of REDUCE requires a minimum of 193 pages of memory to
run.   This  size  will  increase  as  additional facilities are automatically
loaded by user actions.  A default expression workspace of approximately 26000
cells  is also provided, which may prove to be insufficient for some problems.
A command CORE is available to increase the size of the workspace.  This  com-
mand MUST be given at the top level and not from a file since it reinitializes
all file buffers.  CORE takes an integer as argument, representing  the  basic
REDUCE  program  size  in  K words (exclusive of operating system increments).
The minimum value is 60 (the default) and the maximum 124.   For  example,  to
increase the user workspace by 10K words, one would say:

     CORE 70;

at the top level.

6.4  _M_i_s_c_e_l_l_a_n_e_o_u_s

The internal ordering on alphabetic characters is from A through Z followed by
a through z.

To exit REDUCE use either "bye;" or "quit;".  These  are  equivalent.   If  no
non-ephemeral  processes  have been invoked after this, such a job may be res-
tarted by the operating system command CONTINUE.

A number of error messages from the underlying LISP system may  be  seen  from
time to time.  These include:

NO FREE STG LEFT
        Your problem is too large in its present form for the available
        workspace; either change your problem formulation or increase the
        amount of workspace by the CORE command

REG PUSHDOWN CAPACITY EXCEEDED
        Your program probably contains a non-terminating loop that exhausts
        the system's space for recursive references.  If you think your
        program is correct, ask your site consultant to build you a system
        with a bigger pushdown stack.

For further details, the Manual for Standard  LISP  on  DECSYSTEM  10  and  20
should be consulted.
