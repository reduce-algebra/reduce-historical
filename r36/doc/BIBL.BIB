 MONTH = "October", TYPE = "Research Report", NUMBER = 261,
 ABSTRACT = {Coupling constructions are given for two examples of
hypoelliptic diffusions with smooth coefficients:  the two-dimensional
diffusion formed by scalar Brownian motion and its time integral; and the
three-dimensional diffusion formed by planar Brownian motion and its
stochastic area.  In both cases it is shown that one can construct
co-adapted copies of Brownian motion such that the corresponding copies of
the diffusion will couple in finite time.  The first case uses stopping
time arguments; the second is computationally more involved and the
solution was found using a computer algebra implementation of stochastic
calculus (though the final proof has been checked completely by hand).
Questions are formulated about coupling problems for more general
hypoelliptic diffusions with smooth coefficients.}}

 INSTITUTION = "Technischer Bericht",
 YEAR = 1990, TYPE = "Report", NUMBER = "BESSY TB Nr. 158",
 MONTH = "October",
 ABSTRACT = {In this report we present an approximated solution of the
particle motion in wiggler and undulator fields by an algebraic mapping
routine.  The solution is based on a series expansion up to the third
order in the two transversal angle coordinates and, as a third variable,
the bending radius of the particle orbit.  The wiggler and undulator fields
are represented by an expansion as suggested by K. Halbach.

The report consists of two parts.  In the first part we solve the
equations of motion by an iteration procedure, which originally was also
the first approach.  In the second part the solution is based on a Taylor
series expansion.  Both approaches are equivalent.},
ABSTRACT2 = {Beside the presentation of the solution, the main topics
discussed in the two parts are the calculation speed and accuracy of the
algebraic method in comparison to integration methods along undulator
fields, as they are typically applied in lattice design codes.

As a further result of the discussion we obtain a proper canonical mapping
routine at least as accurate but faster than typical integration routines.}}

 ABSTRACT = {An algorithm with its mathematical foundation concerning {2nd}
order ordinary linear differential equations {(OLDE)} is described.  It
allows one to generate related {four-parametric} families of {OLDE} with
coefficients of preassigned (in the scope of the procedure) structures
integrable in terms of a given (generating) equation.  The number of those
families in each next generation grows according to geometric progression
with ratio eight.  Several examples of both mathematical and physical
significance illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm implemented in the
{REDUCE} compute algebra system.}}

truncation is small and calculations are performed symbolically in rational
arithmetic, many of the standard precepets for numerical use of spectral
methods must be modified or reversed.  We offer many guidelines and
suggestions.  Six examples programmed in {REDUCE}, and
Maple---eigenproblems, bifurcations, and nonlinear diffusion--illustrate
the possibilities.}}

the two-loop master diagram is expanded at large and small $q^{2}$, in
$d$ dimensions, using identities derived from integration by parts.
Expansions are given, in terms of hypergeometric series, for all gluon
diagrams and for all but one of the quark diagrams; expansions of the
latter are obtained from differential equations.  Pad\'{e} approximants
to truncations of the expansions are shown to be of great utility.  As an
application, we obtain the two-loop photon self-energy, for all $d$, and
achieve highly accelerated convergence of its expansions in powers of
$q^{2}/m^{2}/q^{2}$, for $d=4$.}}

of $z=q^2/4m^2$.  In the limiting cases $z\to0$, $z\to1$, and $z\to-\infty$,
comparisons are made with previous partial results.  Approximation methods,
based on these limiting cases, are critically assessed, with a view to
three-loop work.  High accuracy is achieved using a few moments as input.
A {\em single\/} moment, combined with only the {\em leading\/} threshold and
asymptotic behaviours, gives the two-loop corrections to better than 1\% in
the next 10 moments.  A two-loop fit to vector data yields
$\langle\frac{\alpha_{\rm s}}{\pi}G^2\rangle\approx0.021$~GeV$^4$}}

 COMMENT = {This paper is devoted to the application of computer algebra to
the study of solutions of the field equations derived from a non-linear
Lagrangian, as suggested by recently proposed unified theories.  More
precisely, we restrict ourselves to the most general quadratic Lagrangian,
i.e. containing quadratic contributions in the different curvature tensors
exclusively.  The corresponding field equations are then fourth-order in the
metric tensor components.  The cosmological models studied are the simplest
ones in the class of spatially homogeneous but anisotropic models,
i.e. Bianchi I models.  For these models, we consider only power-law
type solutions of the field equations.  All the solutions of the associated
system of algebraic equations are found, using computer algebra, from a
search of its Groebner bases.  While, in space dimension d=3, the
Einsteinian-Kasner metric is still the most general power-law type solution,
for d>3, no solution, other than the Minkowski space-time, is common to the
three systems of equations corresponding to the three contributions to the
Lagrangian density.  In the case of a pure Riemann-squared contribution to the
Lagrangian (suggested by a recent calculation of the effective action for
the heterotic string), the possibility exists to realize a splitting of the
d-dimensional space into a (d-3)-dimensional internal space and a physical
3-dimensional space, the latter expanding in time as a power bigger than
2 (about 4.5 when d=9).}}

commutative algebra aimed primarily at undergraduates. It emphasizes 
applications and the computational and algorithmic aspects of the 
subject.  Less abstract than other texts, and with prerequisites 
(a course in linear algebra and any course discussing how to do 
simple proofs), the text is also ideal for computer scientists as
well as mathematicians interested in the subject.  The exposition
assumes that students have access to a computer algebra system such 
as Maple, REDUCE or Mathematica, but assumes no prior experience 
with a computer.

contract to obtain high order analytic solutions to nonlinear hydrodynamic
equation describing steady periodic waves propagating in sheared currents.
The purpose of this work is to provide working formulae for computing
combined wave and current loadings in the design of offshore structures.
Using the {REDUCE} algebra package, we have identified minor typographical
errors in the published fifth coefficients for uniform currents given by
{Fenton [2]} and by Skjelbreia and {Hendrickson [5]}.  We have demonstrated
the equivalence of corrected forms of these expressions to fifth order, and
extended Fenton's expansion to seventh order.  We present a new fifth order
theory for bilinear current profiles. {FORTRAN} software for the seven order
uniform current and fifth order bilinear current theories are given.}}

 ABSTRACT = {{Parameter-dependent} systems of nonlinear equations with
symmetry are treated by a combination of symbolic and numerical computations.
In the symbolic part of the algorithm the complete analysis of the symmetry
occurs, and it is here where symmetrical normal forms, symmetry reduced
systems, and block diagonal Jacobians are computed.  Given a particular
problem, the symbolic algorithm can create and compute through the list of
possible bifurcations thereby forming a {so-called} tree of decisions
correlated to the different types of symmetry breaking bifurcation points.
The remaining part of the algorithm deals with the numerical pathfollowing
based on the implicit reparametrisation as suggested and worked out by
{Deuflhard/Fiedler/Kunkel}.  The symmetry preserving bifurcation points are
computed using recently developed augmented systems incorporating the use
of symmetry.}}

 ABSTRACT = {The numerical treatment of equivariant parameter-dependent

computations which are done in the preparation of the numerical computations.
The bifurcation graph which gives the bifurcation subgroups is determined
from the interrelationship of the irreducible representations of a group
and its subgroups.  The Jacobian is transformed to block diagonal
structure using a modification of the transformation which transforms to
block diagonal structure with respect to a supergroup.  The principle of
conjugacy is used everywhere to make symbolic and numerical computations
even more efficient.  Finally, when the symmetry reduced problems and
blocks of Jacobian matrices are evaluated numerically, the fact that the
given representation is a quasi-permutation representation is exploited
automatically.}}

 COMMENT = {Winkler (1988) and Pauer (1992) present algorithms for a Hensel
lifting of a modular Gr{\"o}bner basis over lucky primes to a rational
one.  They have to solve a linear system with modular polynomial entries
that requires another (modular) Gr{\"o}ner basis computation.
After an extension of luckiness to arbitrary (commutative noetherian) base
rings we show in this paper that for a homogeneous polynomial ideal I one
lift not only only its Gr{\"o}bner basis but also a homogeneous basis of
its syzygy module.  The same result holds for arbitrary ideals and
liftings from Z/p to Q.  Moreover the same lifting can be obtained from a
true Gro{\"o}bner trace by linear algebra over Q only.  Parallel modular
techniques allow to find such a true Gro{\"o}bner and a lucky prime with
high probability.
All these results generalize in an obvious way to homogeneous modules
generated by the rows of matrices with polynomial entries.  Since
luckiness can be weakened to a condition that transfers from I to higher
syzygy modules the lifting theorem generalizes to a lifting theorem for
the resolution of I.}}

 ABSTRACT = {Most algebraic computations which arise from physical problems
have considerable structure in their specification because of the many
physical conservation laws and the nature of our approximation techniques.
The exploitation of this structure is often the reason why hand
calculations of non-trivial problems are possible.  However, most
available algebra systems do not preserve such structure in a consistent
manner, and consequently produce results which are far less comprehensible
than equivalent hand calculations.  In this paper we shall describe
techniques which can utilize the algebraic structure more effectively and
apply them to several examples.}}

 ABSTRACT = {The method of caustics has become a very efficient tool in
crack, hole and many additional plane elasticity problems.  Unfortunately,
the fundamental equation of the caustics frequently requires complicated
algebraic computations including that of a Jacobian determinant.  Here we
show that computer algebra software can prove very efficient in these
computations, using as a vehicle for this illustration the already known
fundamental equation of caustics in dynamic plane elasticity (both for crack
problems in fracture mechanics as well as for hole and additional problems).
We have used the programming capabilities of {REDUCE}, a very popular
computer algebra system, for our algebraic computations.  Moreover, we
illustrate the "learning" abilities of {REDUCE} especially for the
derivation of the complex form of this equation.  The case of static plane
elasticity results simply as a special case of dynamic plane elasticity.
Additional possibilities are suggested in brief.}}

type flip and each sublattice contains {\em n} sequential spins
alternately.  The other has the overlapped multi-spin-flip sequence.  The
state of {\em n} spins at the next time step is selected from ${2}^{n}$
states using the heat-bath type transition probability.  These dynamics of
the Ising chain are equivalent to the statics of the square-lattice Ising
model with a 1 x 2 unit cell or of the triangular-lattice Ising model.
The analytic solutions of the single spin relaxation time of these
dynamics are obtained using these equivalences.}}

relaxation times of single spin expectation functions are calculated.  The
sequential-flip dynamics of {\em n}-site chain has the same correlation
time as the {\em n}-sublattice dynamics.  The relaxation becomes slow when
this {\em n} is made large.  The static models equivalent to these dynamic
models are the Ising models on a triangular lattice with a skew boundary

correlation lengths in the direction perpendicular to the anisotropic

the ratio of the lattice width to boundary skew.}}

 ABSTRACT = {A conformal change of metric is used to construct a coupling
of two time-changed Riemannian Brownian motions, such that there is an
upper bound on the prabability of no coupling before either process leaves
a small geodesic ball, with the bound being linear in the distance between
the two starting points.  This coupling is a more geometric (and
probabilistically less technical) alternative to that introduced by
Cranston (1991).  Together with some modifications it is used to provide a
probabilistic approach to the regularity of harmonic maps, thus completing
the probabilistic construction of solutions to small-image harmonic map
Dirichlet problems described in Kendall (1990).  The approach includes a
mild generalization to the case of harmonic maps defined using
non-Riemannian connections in the target manifold and smooth strictly
elliptic second-order differential operators in the domain.}}

called a hypergeometric term (or closed form) if $a_k/a_{k-1}$ is a
rational function with respect to $k$.  Typical hypergeometric terms are
ratios of products of powers, factorial, Gamma function terms, binomial
coefficients, and shifted factorials (Pochhammer symbols) that are
integer-linear in their arguments.  The package covers further extensions
of both Gosper's and Zeilberger's algorithms.}}

 ABSTRACT = {In this article we present new results for families of
orthogonal polynomials and special functions, that are determined by
algorithmical approaches.

In the first section, we present new results, especially for discrete
families of orthogonal polynomials, obtained by an application of the
celebrated Zeilberger algorithm.

Next, we present algorithms for holonomic families $f(n,x)$ of special
functions which possess a derivative rule.  We call those families
admissible.  A family $f(n,x)$ is holonomic if it satisfies a holonomic
recurrence equation with respect to n, and a holonomic differential
equation with respect to x, i.e. linear homogeneous equations with
polynomial coefficients.

The rather rigid property of admissibility has many interesting
consequences, that can be used to generate and verify identities for these
functions by linear algebra techniques.  On the other hand, many families
of special functions, in particular families of orthogonal polynomials, are
admissible.  We moreover present a method that generates the derivative
rule from the holonomic representation of a holonomic family.

As examples, we find new identities for the Jacobi polynomials and for the
Whittaker functions, and for families of discrete orthogonal polynomials by
the given approach.

Finally, we present representations for the parameter derivatives of the
Gegenbauer and the generalized Laguerre polynomials.}}

 ABSTRACT = {Spectral properties, as determined by trace maps, of the
one-dimensional chains (layered structures) constructed according to
general two-letter substitution rules are investigated.  In all trace maps
thus obtained an important role is played by the quantity
$I=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-xyz-4$ However, only a very small fraction of all
such trace maps are similar to the Fibonacci golden-mean trace map in that
I is their invariant.  In addition to the known case of the precious-mean
lattices (precious means are ratios of the form
$^{1}_{2}[m+(m^{2}+4)^{1/2}]$, m being any positive integer; m=1 gives the
golden mean), we have identified two new large clases of substitution
rules that give trace maps with invariant I.  One of them is a superset of
the precious-mean lattices.  All other cases represent a vast assortment
of different trace maps (and thus the potential for various hitherto
unexplored spectral properties) with a unifying feature that the set I=0
plays the role of an attractor in the trace space.  In most (but not all)
cases, two chains with identical trace maps (and thus identical spectra)
are locally isomorphic.  Generally, local isomorphism equivalence classes
seem to be subsets of identical spectrum equivalence classes.}}

orthogonal.  Algorithms for working with grid functions and grid operators
in symbolic form which are necessary in the basic operator method are
described.  The algorithms have been implemented in the computer algebra
system REDUCE.}}

Individual errors and their effects are identified, and it is shown how to
compute these effects efficiently via automatic differentiation.  In the
presented approach these effects are used to determine which precisions have
to be chosen during the real computations, in order to limit error cumulation
to admissible, user chosen error bounds.}}

 ABSTRACT = {The {CSL} Lisp system is one designed primarily for delivering
Lisp applications to users.  It thus emphasises robustness, portability and
small size rather than support for an integrated programming environment.
Both portability and compactness are served by making CSL compile the bulk
of applications code into a compact byte-code instruction set which is then
emulated.  The speed penalities inherent in this are offset by providing
instrumentation that makes it easy to identify code hot-spots, and a second
compiler that translates critical parts of the original Lisp into C for
incorporation in the CSL kernel.  For use with REDUCE it is found that
compiling about 5% of the source code into C led to overall performance
competetive with other Lisp implementations.}}

 ABSTRACT = "{CSL} is a {Lisp} system specifically designed to support the
{REDUCE} algebra system.  This paper views the {Lisp} system upon which a
{Lisp-coded} algebra system is coded as in effect a micro-kernel -- it
provides basic compilation, storage management and extended arithmetic
capabilities that algebra needs, but is not much concerned with higher level
algebraic algorithms or with user interfaces.  The description of {CSL}
given here discusses the major design decisions embodied in the system, and
shows the extent to which it has been possible to resolve conflicting goals
of simplicity, small size, portability and high performance."}

 YEAR = 1991, TYPE = "Preprint", NUMBER = "SC 91-13", MONTH = "December",
 ABSTRACT = {The numerical solution of optimal control problems by indirect
methods (such as multiple shooting or collocation) requires a considerable
amount of analytic calculation to establish a numerically tractable system.
These analytic calculations, though being rather tedious in realistic
examples, are nowadays mostly still done by hand--and thus prone to
calculation errors.  The paper aims at automating this analytic processing
to a reasonable extent by means of a modern symbolic manipulation language
(here:  REDUCE).  In its present stage of development the package OCCAL
(mnemotechnically for Optimal Control CALculator) permits an interactive
use, covering tasks like automatic determination of control and, in case of a
singular control, of its order.  In simpler problems, the present version of
OCCAL automatically produces the full subroutine input for a MULtiple
shooting code (MULCON) with adaptive numerical CONtinuation.

In more complicated problems where singular sub-arcs may occur or where the
sequence of sub-arcs of the optimal trajectory is unclear OCCAL is a
significant help in reducing analytic pre-processing.  Examples illustrate
the performance of OCCAL/MULCON.}}

 ABSTRACT = {Factorization and testing for irreducibility has turned out to
be one of the most important algorithms for handling linear ode's.  The
main hindrance for applying it is its trmendous complexity originating to a
large extent from solving certain Riccati equations which occur during the
factorization.  The solution procedure for these Riccati equations is much
more manageable if it is subdivided into two major parts.  At first so
called solution candidates are determined each of which depends only on the
parameters of a single irreducible denominator or the behavior at infinity.
In a second step it is tried to complete each candidate into a genuine
solution of the Riccati equation, possibly including an unspecified number
of additional first order poles.  Furthermore a scheme is proposed for
running the factorization procedure in parallel on a two-processor machine
in which possible factors are searched for both from the right and the left
at the same time.}}

 YEAR = 1993, VOLUME = 15, NUMBER = 4, PAGES = "371-391", MONTH = "November",
 COMMENT = {The ring of polynomials in $X,X_{1}, \1dots ,X_{m}$ are denoted
by $F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \1dots ,X_{m}]$ in $F_{p}$, that is the field of
integers defined modulo $p$. In the usual factorization algorithm defined
by Wang, the given polynolmial $P$ is first factorized modulo $\Delta^{n}$,
where $\Delta^{n}$ is an ideal.  This algorithm uses a generalization of
Hensel's Lemma.  If there are no extraneous factors, then the factors
defined modulo $\delta^[{n}$ correspond to the factors of $P$ in
$F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \1dots ,X_{m}]$ or else the defined factors must be
regrouped to find the factors of $P$ in $F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \1dots ,X_{m}]$.
In this paper, a mapping that transforms the product of the factors into a
sum is defined.  A theorem that determines whether a subproduct of the
factors of $P$ corresponds to a factor of $P$ in $F_{p}[X,X_{1}, \1dots
,X_{m}]$ is given.  Therefore the regrouping of the factors of $P$ reduces
to solving a system of linear equations, as in the univariate case, with
Berlekamp's algorithm.}}

 ABSTRACT = {In this paper the programs APPLYSYM, QUASILINPDE and DETRAFO
are described which aim at the utilization of infinitesimal symmetries of
differential equations.  The purpose of QUASILINPDE is the general solution
of quasilinear PDEs.  This procedure is used by APPLYSYM for the
application of point symmetries for either

calculating similarity variables to perform a point transformation which
lowers the order of an ODE or effectively reduces the number of explicitly
occuring independent variables in a PDE(-system) or for

generalizing given special solutions of ODEs/PDEs with new constant
parameters.

The program DETRAFO performs arbitrary point- and contact transformations
of ODEs/PDEs and is applied if similarity and symmetry variables have been
found.  The program APPLYSYM is used in connection with the program LIEPDE
for formulating and solving the conditions for point- and contact
symmetries which is described in [4].  The actual problem solving is done
in all these programs through a call to the package CRACK for solving
overdetermined PDE-systems.}}
