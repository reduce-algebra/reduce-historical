
    INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTING MATERIAL TO THE REDUCE NETWORK LIBRARY

We encourage users to send contributions to the REDUCE network library.  The
rules are simple, and are designed to increase the effectiveness of the
contribution rather than make more work for the contributor.

Messages (and also code comments if possible) should be in English.  REDUCE
is an international system, used by scientists in many countries who speak
many different languages.  The only way to make such a system effective is
to have all dialog in one language, which for obvious reasons is English.

Lines of code should have a maximum length of 71 characters, and only
contain the symbols listed in the REDUCE User's Manual.  Other files
should not contain lines longer than 80 characters.  No file should be
more than 100,000 bytes long.  This is required so that all known REDUCE
systems can process the code, and electronic mail systems handle the
transmission of the relevant files.

In the case of a complete package, the following is required:

 1. A header comment listing
      a) the title of the program,
      b) the name and address of the author(s), including network address,
      c) the date of the program,
      d) a brief abstract,
      e) the version of REDUCE required,
      f) relevant publications,
      g) appropriate keywords.

 2. A separate document file describing the use of the program, preferably
    in LaTeX using the style file reduce.sty in the documents directory.

 3. A test file.  This should consist of a sequence of commands that neither
    read input nor output to files other than the standard output device.

 4. A log of the output from running the test file.

 5. A signed REDUCE Contribution Form giving us rights to the
    distribution of the code.

For smaller code fragments and other material, only the signed form is
needed.  This form follows.
