To the best of my knowledge, I have the right to contribute this program

computation system and its associated program libraries and to Arthur C.
Norman/Codemist Ltd ("Codemist") for possible use in the CSL Lisp system
and associated software.  I agree that Hearn and Codemist
may use, duplicate, modify, publish, distribute and market the program
material, and authorize others to do so without obligation or liability of
any kind.  They may publish my name and address, as the contributor, to
facilitate user inquiries pertaining to this program material.
