          202/Global Explanation: Kill Ring

           201/The kill ring is a stack of the 16 most recently killed pieces of text.  The
          Insert Kill Buffer command reads text on the top of the kill ring and inserts
          it back into the buffer.  It can accept an argument, specifying an argument
          other than the top one.  If one knows that the text one wants is on the kill
          ring, but is not certain how deeply it is buried, one can retrieve the top
          item with the Insert Kill Buffer command, then look through the other items
          one by one with the Unkill Previous command.  This rotates the items on the
          kill ring, displaying them one by one in a cycle.
           Most kill commands push their text onto the top of the kill ring.  If two kill
          commands are performed right after each  other,  the  text  they  kill  is
          concatenated.  Commands the kill forward add onto the end of the previously
          killed text.  Commands that kill backward add onto the beginning. That way,
          the text is assembled in its original order.  If intervening commands have
          taken place one can issue an Append Next Kill command before the next kill
          in order to assemble the next killed text together with the text on top of the
          kill ring.
