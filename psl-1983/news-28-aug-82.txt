------------------------------ EMODE Changes ------------------------------

A new PSL has been installed with the following changes made to EMODE:

1. C-X C-R (Read File) now replaces the contents of the current buffer
   with the contents of the file, instead of inserting the contents
   of the file at the current location in the buffer.  This is an
   INCOMPATIBLE change.  (If you want to insert a file, you can first
   read it into an auxiliary buffer.)
2. File INPUT and OUTPUT have been speeded up greatly (by a factor of 5).
   Still noticably slower than EMACS, however.
3. Three bugs in file I/O have been fixed: (a) EMODE no longer treats a ^Z
   in a file as an end-of-file mark; (b) EMODE will no longer lose the
   last line of a file should it lack a terminating CRLF; (c) EMODE no
   longer appends a spurious blank line when writing to a file.
4. Many more EMACS commands have been implemented (see list below).
   Please note that Lisp Indentation (available using TAB, LineFeed,
   and C-M-Q) makes many bad choices.  These deficiencies are known, but
   it was decided that in this case something was better than nothing.
   Complaints about indentation are considered redundant.

Send bug reports to "PSL@Hulk".

New EMODE commands:

  C-Q             (Quoted Insert)
  M-\             (Delete Horizontal Space)
  C-X C-O         (Delete Blank Lines)
  M-M and C-M-M   (Back to Indentation)
  M-^             (Delete Indentation)
  M-@             (Mark Word)
  C-X H           (Mark Whole Buffer)
  C-M-@           (Mark Sexp)
  Tab             (Indent for Lisp)
  LineFeed        (Indent New Line)
  C-M-U           (Backward Up List) [ should also be C-M-( ]
  C-M-O           (Forward Up List)  [ should be C-M-) ]
  C-M-A and C-M-[ (Beginning of Defun)
  C-M-D           (Down List)
  C-M-E and C-M-] (End of Defun)
  C-M-H           (Mark Defun)
  C-M-N           (Next List)
  C-M-P           (Previous List)
  C-M-Q           (Indent Sexp)
  M-(             (Insert Parens)
  M-)             (Move over Paren)

PSL NEWS FLASH!! -- August 10, 1982


CATCH

An implementation of CATCH with "correct" semantics is on its
way.  Eric Benson has an implementation that allows code for the
body of the CATCH to be compiled in line.  Variables used free
inside the body will not have to be declared fluid.  Unhandled
exceptions will, unfortunately, continue to result in abort to
the top level.

BUG FIXES

Be sure to peruse PSL:BUGS.TXT.  In addition to an invaluable
compilation of commentary, bug reports and just plain flaming,
this file contains reports of some fixes to bugs!

TOKEN SCANNER FOUND WANTING

The current PSL token scanner has been tried in the balance and
found wanting.  Eric Benson says it was ripped off from some
other token scanner in rather a hurry and needs to be replaced.

PACKAGE SYSTEM ALSO FOUND WANTING

Sources close to Doug Lanam report that the PSL "package system"
is not adequate.  We asked Martin Griss, "What about the package
system?".  He admitted the inadequacy, calling the package system
"experimental" and saying that the fasloader needs to know about
packages.

EMODE IMPROVED AND DOCUMENTED

Some improvements to EMODE are described in the key documentation
file PSL:HP-PSL.IBM (and .LPT).  Enhancements continue at a rapid
pace, leading one experienced observer to comment, "Looks like
Alan has really been tearing into EMODE -- impressive!".  The
file PE:DISPATCH.DOC contains some key information on
customization of EMODE.  More reports to come.

A new version of "NPSL" has been installed with the following
changes:

  * EMODE now uses clear-EOL for faster redisplay.
  * EMODE's start-up glitches have been removed.  EMODE will
    now start up in 1-window mode.
  * A "compile" command has been added; you can now say
    "PSL compile foo" to EXEC to compile the file "foo.sl".
    (This feature has been added to both PSL and NPSL.)
