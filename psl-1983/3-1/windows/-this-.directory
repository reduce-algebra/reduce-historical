This directory contains the sources and non-loadable binaries for the Window
package used by NMode.  The window package consists of two loadable modules:
WINDOWS and DISPLAY-CHAR.  WINDOWS is the main module and is essential.
DISPLAY-CHAR is a module that defines some macros for manipulating "display
characters", which are used in the Window Package.  Load this module at
compile time if you use any of these macros.
