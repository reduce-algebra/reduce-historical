The Names and State of important Flags and Globals can be displayed
by executing:

ShowFlags(Flag-name-list) or ShowGlobals(Global-Name-List)

If the List is NIL, some default set of Flags or Globals will be
displayed.  Each Flag or Global will have a short descriptive string
associated with it, under the indicator 'FlagInfo or 'GlobalInfo.

These are stored with 
	DefineFlag(Id,Info-String)  % Note that ID does NOT include the !*
and
	DefineGlobal(Global,Info-string)
