INSPECT	                      M.L. Griss, Monday, 31 May 1982
-------

This is a simple utility to scan the contents of a source file to tell
what functions are defined in it.  It will be embellished slightly to
permit the on-line querying of certain attributes of files.  INSPECT
reads one or more files, printing and collecting information on
defined functions.

Usage:

LOAD INSPECT;

INSPECT "file-name"; % Scans the file, and prints proc names.
	             % It also builds the lists ProcedureList!*
                     % FileList!* and ProcFileList!*

		     % File-Name can IN other files

On the Fly printing is controlled by !*PrintInspect, default is T.
Other lists built include FileList!* and ProcFileList!*, which
is a list of (procedure . filename) for multi-file processing.

For more complete process, do:

LOAD Inspect;
Off PrintInspect;
InspectOut(); % Later will get a file Name
IN ....;
IN ...;
InspectEnd;

Now use Gsort etc. to process the lists
