          202/23.  Correcting Mistakes and NMODE Problems

          201/If you type an NMODE command you did not intend, the results are often
          mysterious.  This chapter tells what you can do to cancel your mistake or
          recover from a mysterious situation.  NMODE bugs and system crashes are
          also considered.

          202/23.1  Quitting and Aborting

                  201/C-G    Quit.  Cancel partially typed command.

            There  are  two  ways  of  cancelling  commands  which  are  not  finished
          executing: 202/quitting 201/with C-G (203/nmode-abort-command201/), and 202/aborting 201/with C-C
          on Twenex or STOP on the hp9836.  Quitting is cancelling a partially typed
          command.   Aborting is cancelling a command which is already running.
          Aborting generally doesn't allow a  clean  re-entry  into  the  old  NMODE
          environment so it is generally not recommended.

            Quitting with C-G is used for getting rid of a partially typed command, or
          a numeric argument that you don't want.  Quitting an incremental search does
          special things documented under searching; in general, it may take two
          successive C-G's to get out of a search.

          202/23.1.1  Garbage on the Screen

            201/If the data on the screen looks wrong, it could be due to line noise on
          input or output, a bug in the terminal, a bug in NMODE redisplay, or a bug
          in an NMODE command.  To find out whether there is really anything wrong
          with your text, the first thing to do is type C-L.  This is a command to
          clear the screen and redisplay it.   Often this will display the text you
          expected.  Think of it as getting an opinion from another doctor.

          202/23.2  Reporting Bugs

            201/Sometimes you will encounter a bug in NMODE.  To get it fixed, you must
          report it.  It is your duty to do so; but you must know when to do so and
          how if it is to be constructive.

          202/23.2.1  When Is There a Bug

            201/If NMODE executes an illegal instruction, or dies with an operating system
          error message that indicates a problem in the program (as opposed to "disk
          full"), then it probably is a bug.

            We say "probably" because you can also cause these errors yourself if you
          execute your own code or modify NMODE by redefining its functions or
          changing its variables.

            If NMODE updates the display in a way that does not correspond to what is
          in the buffer, then it is probably a bug.  If a command seems to do the
          wrong thing but the problem is gone if you type C-L, then it is a case of
          incorrect display updating.

            Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you must make
          certain that it was really NMODE's fault.  Some commands simply take a long
          time.

            If a command you are familiar with causes an NMODE error message in a
          case where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is probably a bug.

            If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug.  But be sure you know
          for certain what it ought to have done.   If you aren't familiar with the
          command, or don't know for certain how the command is supposed to work,
          then it might actually be working right.  Rather than jumping to conclusions,
          show the problem to someone who knows for certain.

            Finally, a command's intended definition may not be best for editing with.
          This is a very important sort of problem, but it is also a matter of judgment.
          Also, it is easy to come to such a conclusion out of ignorance of some of the
          existing features.  It is probably best not to complain about such a problem
          until you have checked the documentation in the usual ways, feel confident
          that you understand it, and know for certain that what you want is not
          available.  If you feel confused about the documentation instead, then you
          don't have grounds for an opinion about whether the command's definition is
          optimal.  Make sure you read it through and check the index or the menus
          for all references to subjects you don't fully understand.  If you have done
          this diligently and are still confused, or if you finally understand but think
          you could have said it better, then you have a constructive complaint to make
          203/about the documentation201/.  It is just as important to report documentation
          bugs as program bugs.

          202/23.2.2  How to Report a Bug

            201/When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it and to
          report it in a way which is useful.   What is most useful is an exact
          description of what commands you type, starting with a fresh NMODE just
          loaded, until the problem happens.  Send the bug report to the author (see
          the preface for the address).

            The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report 203/facts201/, not
          hypotheses or conditions.  It is always easier to report the facts, but people
          seem to prefer to strain to think up explanations and report them instead.  If
          the explanations are based on guesses about how NMODE is implemented, they
          will be useless; we will have to try to figure out what the facts must have
          been to lead to such speculations.  Sometimes this is impossible.  But in any
          case, it is unnecessary work for us.

            For example, suppose that you type C-X C-V <GLORP>BAZ.UGH<CR>,
          visiting a file which (you know) happens to be rather large, and NMODE
          prints out "I feel pretty today".  The best way to report the bug is with a
          sentence like the preceding one, because it gives all the facts and nothing
          but the facts.

            Do not assume that the problem is due to the size of the file and say "When
          I visit a large file, NMODE prints out 'I feel pretty today'".  This is what we
          mean by "guessing explanations".  The problem is just as likely to be due to
          201/NMODE Manual (How to Report a Bug)                              Page 23-3


          the fact that there is a "Z" in the filename.  If this is so, then when we got
          your report, we would try out the problem with some "big file", probably
          with no "Z" in its name, and not find anything wrong.  There is no way in
          the world that we could guess that we should try visiting a file with a "Z" in
          its name.

            Alternatively, the problem might be due to the fact that the file starts with
          exactly 25 spaces.  For this reason, you should make sure that you don't
          change the file until we have looked at it.  Suppose the problem only occurs
          when you have typed the C-X C-A command previously?  This is why we ask
          you to give the exact sequence of characters you typed since loading the
          NMODE.

            You should not even say "visit the file ..." instead of "C-X C-V" unless
          you 203/know 201/that it makes no difference which visiting command is used.
          Similarly, rather than saying "if I have three characters on the line", say
          "after I type <CR>A B C<CR>C-P", if that is the way you entered the text.
          In addition, you should say what mode you are in.

            If the bug occurred in a customized NMODE, it is helpful to try to
          reproduce the bug in a more standard NMODE.  It is best if you can make
          the problem happen in a completely standard NMODE.  If the problem does
          203/not 201/occur in a standard NMODE, it is very important to report that fact,
          because otherwise we will try to debug it in a standard NMODE, not find the
          problem, and give up.  If the problem does depend on an init file, then you
          should make sure it is not a bug in the init file by complaining to the person
          who wrote the file, first.  He should check over his code, and verify the
          definitions of the PSL commands he is using.  Then if he verifies that the
          bug is in NMODE he should report it.   We cannot be responsible for
          maintaining users' init files; we might not even be able to tell what they are
          supposed to do.

            If you can tell us a way to cause the problem without reading in any files,
          please do so.  This makes it much easier to debug.  If you do need files,
          make sure you arrange for us to see their exact contents.  For example, it
          can often matter whether there are spaces at the ends of lines, or a line
          separator after the last line in the buffer (nothing ought to care whether the
          last line is terminated, but tell that to the bugs).
