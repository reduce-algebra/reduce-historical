          202/7.  Moving Up And Down Levels


            201/Subsystems and recursive editing levels are two states in which you are
          temporarily doing something other than editing the visited file as usual.  For
          example,  you  might  be  editing the arguments prompted for by a M-X
          command, or using a browser.

          202/7.1  Subsystems

            201/A 202/subsystem 201/is an NMODE function which is an interactive program in its
          own right: it reads commands in a language of its own, and displays the
          results.  You enter a subsystem by typing an NMODE command which invokes
          it.  Once entered, the subsystem usually runs until a specific command to
          exit the subsystem is typed.  An example of an NMODE subsystem is the
          buffer-browser, invoked by typing C-X C-B.

            The commands understood by a subsystem are usually not like NMODE
          commands, because their purpose is something other than editing text.  In
          the buffer-browser, for instance, the commands are tailored to moving up and
          down a list of the existing buffers, reordering this list in various ways, and
          to  deleting  buffers.   In  NMODE,  most  commands  are  Control  or  Meta
          characters  because  printing  characters  insert  themselves.     In  most
          subsystems, there is no insertion of text, so non-Control non-Meta characters
          can be the commands.

            While you are inside a subsystem, the mode line identifies the subsystem by
          identifying the mode of the current buffer.  The special properties of the
          subsystem are due to the kinds of commands that are available in this mode,
          and to the keys that the mode associates with them.  Because each buffer has
          its own associated mode at any given time, if a user moves out of the buffer
          associated with the subsystem into an ordinary text buffer, he/she will have
          left the subsystem, even though he/she will not have used the normal
          command for doing so.

            Because each subsystem implements its own commands, we cannot guarantee
          anything about them.   However, there are conventions for what certain
          commands ought to do:

                  Space          Moves downwards, like C-N in NMODE.
                  Q              Exits normally.
                  Help or ?      Prints documentation on the subsystem's commands.

          Not all of these necessarily exist in every subsystem, however.

          202/7.2  Recursive Editing Levels

            201/A 202/recursive editing level 201/is a state in which part of the execution of one
          command involves doing some editing.  You may be editing the file you are
          working on, or you may be editing completely something totally different from
          what you were working on at top level.   Currently, the completion of
          extended commands, the preparation of prompted input strings, and the
          examination of buffers in the kill-some-buffers-command function all involve
