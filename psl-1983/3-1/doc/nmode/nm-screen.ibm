          202/2.  The Organization of the Screen

            201/NMODE divides the screen into several areas, each of which contains its
          own sorts of information.  The biggest area, of course, is the one in which
          you usually see the text you are editing.  The terminal's cursor usually
          appears in the middle of the text, showing the position of 202/point201/, the location
          at which editing takes place.   While the cursor appears to point 203/at 201/a
          character, point should be thought of as 203/between 201/two characters; it points
          203/before 201/the character that the cursor appears on top of.  Terminals have only
          one cursor, and when output is in progress it must appear where the typing
          is being done.  This does not mean that point is moving.  It is only that
          NMODE has no way to show you the location of point except when the terminal
          is idle.

          One terminal function which 203/is 201/flexible is the choice of normal or inverse
          video for displaying text.  Nmode lets you toggle this feature with the C-X V
          (203/nmode-invert-video201/) command.

            A few lines at the bottom of the screen compose what is called the 202/echo
          area201/.   202/Echoing 201/means printing out the commands that you type.  NMODE
          commands are usually not echoed at all, but if you pause for more than a
          second in the middle of a multi-character command then all the characters
          typed so far are echoed.  This is intended to 202/prompt 201/you for the rest of the
          command.  The rest of the command is echoed, too, as you type it.  This
          behavior is designed to give confident users optimum response, while giving
          hesitant users maximum feedback.

            NMODE also uses the echo area for reading and displaying the arguments
          for some commands, such as searches, and for printing brief information in
          response to certain commands.

          202/2.1  The Mode Line

            201/The line above the echo area is known as the 202/mode line201/.  It is the line that
          usually starts with "NMODE something".  Its purpose is to tell you anything
          that may affect the meaning of your commands aside from the text itself.

          NMODE major (minor) [bfr] file --pos-- *

            202/major 201/is always the name of the 202/major mode 201/you are in.  At any time,
          NMODE is in one and only one of its possible major modes.  The major modes
          available include Text mode, Lisp mode (which NMODE starts out in), Recurse
          mode, Browser modes, and others.  See Section 20.1 [Major Modes], page 1,
          for details of how the modes differ and how to select one.

            202/minor 201/is a list of some of the 202/minor modes 201/that are turned on at the
          moment.  "Fill" means that Auto Fill mode is on.

            202/bfr 201/is the name of the currently selected 202/buffer201/.  Each buffer has its own
          name and holds a file being edited; this is how NMODE can hold several files
          at once.  But at any time you are editing only one of them, the 202/selected
          201/buffer.  When we speak of what some command does to "the buffer", we are
          talking about the currently selected buffer.  Multiple buffers make it easy to
          201/Page 2-2                                      NMODE Manual (The Mode Line)


          switch around between several files, and then it is very useful that the mode
          line tells you which one you are editing at any time.  However, before you
          learn how to use multiple buffers, you will always be in the buffer called
          "Main", which is one that exists when NMODE starts up.  If the name of the
          buffer is the same as the name of the file you are visiting, then the buffer
          name is left out of the mode line.  See Section 16 [Buffers], page 1, for how
          to use more than one buffer in one NMODE.

            202/file 201/is the name of the file that you are editing.  It is the last file that was
          visited in the buffer you are in.

            The star at the end of the mode line means that there are changes in the
          buffer that have not been saved in the file.  If the file has not been changed
          since it was read in or saved, there is no star.

            202/pos 201/tells you whether there is additional text above the top of the screen,
          or below the bottom.  If your file is small and it is all on the screen, --pos--
          is omitted.  Otherwise, it is --TOP-- if you are looking at the beginning of
          the file, --BOT-- if you are looking at the end of the file, or --nn%-- where
          nn is the percentage of the file above the top of the screen.

            If you are accustomed to other display editors, you may be surprised that
          NMODE does not always display the page number and line number of point in
          the mode line.  This is because the text is stored in a way that makes it
          difficult to compute this information.  Displaying them all the time would be
          too slow to be borne.  However, once you are adjusted to NMODE, you will
          rarely have any reason to be concerned with page numbers or line numbers.
