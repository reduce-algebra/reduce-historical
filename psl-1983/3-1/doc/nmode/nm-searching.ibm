          202/12.  Searching

            201/Like other editors, NMODE has commands for searching for an occurrence of
          a string.  The search command is unusual in that it is 202/incremental201/; it begins
          to search before you have finished typing the search string.  As you type in
          the search string, NMODE shows you where it would be found.  When you
          have typed enough characters to identify the place you want, you can stop.
          Depending on what you will do next, you may or may not need to terminate
          the search explicitly with an Escape (Execute on the hp9836) first.

                  C-S        Search forward.
                  C-R        Search backward.

            The command to search is C-S (203/incremental-search-command201/).  C-S reads in
          characters and positions the cursor at the first occurrence of the characters
          that you have typed.  If you type C-S and then F, the cursor moves right
          after the first "F".  Type an "O", and see the cursor move to after the first
          "FO".  After another "O", the cursor is after the first "FOO" after the place
          where you started the search.  At the same time, the "FOO" has echoed at
          the bottom of the screen.

            If you type a mistaken character, you can delete it.   After the FOO,
          typing a Backspace makes the "O" disappear from the bottom of the screen,
          leaving only "FO".  The cursor moves back to the "FO".  Deleting the "O"
          and "F" moves the cursor back to where you started the search.

            When you are satisfied with the place you have reached, you can type an
          Escape, which stops searching, leaving the cursor where the search brought
          it.   Also, any command not specially meaningful in searches stops the
          searching and is then executed.  204/1 201/Thus, typing C-A would exit the search
          and then move to the beginning of the line.  escape is necessary only if the
          next command you want to type is a printing character, Rubout, Backspace,
          Escape, C-Q, or another search command, since those are the characters that
          have special meanings inside the search.

            Sometimes you search for "FOO" and find it, but not the one you expected
          to find.  There was a second FOO that you forgot about, before the one you
          were looking for.  Then type another C-S and the cursor will find the next
          FOO.  This can be done any number of times.  If you overshoot, you can
          delete the C-S's.

            After you exit a search, you can search for the same string again by
          typing just C-S C-S: one C-S command to start the search and then another
          C-S to mean "search again".

          201/ 1.  A few other commands are not executed after a search.  Most special
          function keys send commands which begin with Escape.  This escape is taken
          as terminating the search, and the rest of the command is then executed.
          ESC-A, for instance, will terminate the search and insert A, instead of
          terminating the search and jumping up a line.

            If your string is not found at all, the echo area says "Failing I-Search".
          The cursor is after the place where NMODE found as much of your string as
          it could.  Thus, if you search for FOOT, and there is no FOOT, you might
          see the cursor after the FOO in FOOL.   At this point there are several
          things you can do.  If your string was mistyped, you can rub some of it out
          and correct it.  If you like the place you have found, you can type Escape
          or some other NMODE command to "accept what the search offered".  Or you
          can type C-G, which throws away the characters that could not be found (the
          "T" in "FOOT"), leaving those that were found (the "FOO" in "FOOT").  A
          second C-G at that point undoes the search entirely.

            The C-G "quit" command does special things during searches; just what,
          depends on the status of the search.  If the search has found what you
          specified and is waiting for input, C-G cancels the entire search.   The
          cursor moves back to where you started the search.  If C-G is typed while
          the search is actually searching for something or updating the display, or
          after search failed to find some of your input (having searched all the way to
          the end of the file), then only the characters which have not been found are
          discarded.  Having discarded them, the search is now successful and waiting
          for more input, so a second C-G will cancel the entire search.  Make sure
          you wait for the first C-G to ring the bell before typing the second one; if
          typed  too  soon,  the  second  C-G may be confused with the first and
          effectively lost.

            You can also type C-R at any time to start searching backwards.  If a
          search fails because the place you started was too late in the file, you should
          do this.  Repeated C-R's keep looking for more occurrences backwards.  A
          C-S starts going forwards again.  C-R's can be rubbed out just like anything
          else.  If you know that you want to search backwards, you can use C-R
          instead  of  C-S  to  start  the  search,  because  C-R  is  also a command
          (203/reverse-search-command201/) to search backward.

            All sorts of searches in NMODE normally ignore the case of the text they
          are searching through; if you specify searching for FOO, then Foo and foo
          are also considered a match.
