Need to experiment with NBIG0 on Apollo. There may be still a small bug.

Test as follows. Ship that latest NBIG0.RED that I sent you, rebuild it.
Then ship and built PT:nbtest stuff.

Load NBIG.LAP and NBTEST.B, call NTEST1 40; show1 40.

This should work, and you should see a smooth range of INTEGERS, NEG intergers
and correspnding floats (good test of WRUTE-FLOAT)


Then call SETBITS 32; rerun NTEST1 40; SHOW1 40; I get signs incorrectly
flipping at FIXNUM/BIGNUM transition points.

I belive its related to a possibel BUG in 32-bit arith. 

Also compare <griss>32-bit.red with what lowder is running.
