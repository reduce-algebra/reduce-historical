Bug:	There is no EXPR for reading files
Fix:	Change DSKIN from a FEXPR to a one argument EXPR
By:	Eric
Date:	12:14pm  Tuesday, 5 October 1982
Source:	PI:DSKIN.RED
Module:	IO in kernel
Remarks: This change is incompatible for those using DSKIN with multiple
	arguments.  These uses will have to change to multiple DSKINs.

Feature: The printing functions use the variables PRINLEVEL and PRINLENGTH,
	as described in the Common Lisp Manual.

Remarks:	Some errors still remain, in BLDIFF, etc. and
        minor typo's fixed.

By:	Eric

Source:	PU:DEBUG.RED
Module:	DEBUG
Remarks: Also made DEBUG use CODE-NUMBER-OF-ARGUMENTS to find out the
	# of arguments to a compiled function.

Feature: The printing function for code pointers prints the number of
	arguments expected, in the format #<Code 3 284313>, where 3
	is the # of arguments and 284313 is the address.  The address
	part is now printed in the "preferred" radix of the machine,
	defined by the WConst CompressedBinaryRadix, which is 8 on the
	Dec-20 and Cray, and 16 on the Vax, 68000, and 360.

Remarks:

Bug:	No way to find out how many arguments a compiled function gets.
Fix:	Put a header above the entry point with the # of arguments,
	accessed by the function CODE-NUMBER-OF-ARGUMENTS, which expects
	a code pointer as its argument and returns the number of arguments
	the code pointer expects, or NIL.

Remarks: Only functions compiled since this change have the header word;
	old FASL files will have to be recompiled to make use of this
	feature.
