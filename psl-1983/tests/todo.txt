Improvement to Test Series and Boot Sequence

Start using the LinkReg in Link, LinkE
   [See PT20:dec20-patches.sl]

Improve portability of FUNCTION-PRIMITIVES.RED
   [See TEST-FUNCTION-PRIMITIVES, using *JCALL for all.
    Maybe go to SYMFNC=ADDRESS table ?]

May need to add a new CMACRO or two, or expand CMACRO's, to permit
indirect JUMP via a register/location, to define CodePrimitive().

Modify TEST5 and TEST6 to use the various portable  APPLY etc.

Add BINARY IO tests to I/O. Perhaps as a file of LAP to read in?

Define a FASLIN/FASLOUT tester.
