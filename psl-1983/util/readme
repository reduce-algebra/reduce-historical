The files in this directory constitute the most recent version of the
Portable Standard LISP Manual.  Each file is a separate chapter, and
is preceded by its chapter number; e.g. 03-RLISP.LPT is the third
chapter and discusses RLISP.  Some other information is available in
the files with no chapter number and in PD:*.DOC.

To read these files in Emacs, use the Library available in uem:
called Clean-files; there is a function called Clean LPT File
which can put an lpt file into emacs-readbale form.
That is, do:
<Meta-X> Load Library$uem:Clean-Files
<Meta-X> Clean LPT File$
Please do not change the version on PLPT:!
