          Working on the PSL sources

When you desire to work on any of the PSL sources and will want to place
them back into the PSL system you must use the check-out/in procedure
outlined here.

As a preliminary, you must place in your Comand.cmd file the following line:
     dec/noc env <psl.util>co
This will define the 3 commands used to check files (co, unco and ci).

Check Out
     When you want to check out a file or files, issue the CO command
     followed by the name(s) of the file(s).  This will record in a
     data base file the fact that you have them checked out and will
     inhibit anyone else from checking them out.  Then it will send a mail
     message to the Czar's at HP and here.  For example,
       CO pc:compiler.red  
       CO pc:compiler.* 
       CO pu:rlisp-support.red, pu:rlisp-parser.red
     The CO command will accept wildcards and the escape key functions
     in the normal manner.  If someone has already checked out a file,
     you will be so informed, including the person who checked it out
     and the date and time it was done.

Un Check Out
     If you decide later that you really didn't want to check the file out,
     you may cancel your check out by issuing the UNCO command, followed
     by the file(s) that you want to cancel.  You may only UNCO files that
     you have checked out, you may not UNCO anyone else's files.  It has
     the same format as CO above.

Check In
     Finally, when you are finished making changes and are satisfied that
     the changes are complete and well documented, you may check the files
     back in using the CI command, followed by the file(s) that you want to
     check back in.  This will send a message to the Local Czar.  It is
     your responsibility to copy the file from your local directory to the
     newversions directory.

Note: These do not perform any automatic file copy.  Should we add this??
That is, upon CO, it copies the files to your currently connected directory
and when you CI it copies from your connected directory to the
newversions??
