Loading LAP files
-----------------

FASL and LAP files for useful utilities are stored on <psl.lap>=PL:.

(LapIN "full-filename")		will load a file from any directory
(Load m1 m2 m3 ...)		will load files "PL:m1.B" (or .LAP) etc.
				(mi's may be strings or ids)

To build a FASL file xxx.b from a file yyy.red [in RLISP], do:
FaslOut "xxx";
in "yyy.red";
FaslEnd;

To use the resulting file xxx.b, one can use the function FaslIn:
FaslIn "xxx.b";
Load xxx; uses the FaslIn function.
