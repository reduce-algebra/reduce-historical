This directory contains (short) help files describing modules in
Portable Standard LISP.  These are accessed by the (HELP) command.

Look at PSL.HLP, RLISP.HLP, and HELP.HLP to get started.  (These are
mostly hints to someone familiar with LISP, and slightly familiar with
PSL; for more detail, see the information in <PSL.DOC>xxxx.DOC or
<psl.lpt>xxxx.LPT).
