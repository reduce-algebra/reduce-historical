Subject: PSL project distribution list
To: PSL-Project: ;

There is now a PSL project distribution list, <apptech.dist>psl-project..
Mail to this list is also sent to <hp-psl.misc>project-mail.txt.
I personally have a logical device definition "dist:" that refers
to both <apptech.dist> and <distribution>, thus:
define dist: <apptech.dist>, <distribution>

Subject: PSL.EXE
To: PSL-Project: ;

The file PSL.EXE has been moved from <unsupported> to <psl>.
<unsupported> contains a small file named psl.exe which runs
<psl>psl.exe.

This was done for a couple of reasons:  members of the group
without access to <unsupported> (part of sys:) will be able to
install a new PSL;  also this means that one can either just
run "PSL" or follow the PSL manual's advice and run psl:psl
with equal results.

Probably PSL should really be on <HP-PSL>, but I got extra space
from Tim for PSL on <PSL>, so let's leave things be for a couple
of weeks.

The arrangements with psl.exe described in the previous note apply
on both HULK and THOR.

Eric and I leave for LISP82 tomorrow ~10:30am; Eric returns
Wednesday evening, with a plan of packing and leaving for Palo Alto over
the weekend. I return Thursday evening, and will be packing over the
weekend, with a paln of leaving Thursday.


Please exercise the various systems, and discuss problems with Steve Lowder.
Eric will be able to give a small amount of final advice ~end of the week,
and I will have a few more days. After that, Steve will be in charge
of local maintenance. We will not update system until we get established
at HP, early September, and get reasonable network access to Utah.

Subject: PSL distribution lists
To: PSL-Project: ;

Three PSL-related mail distribution lists are now on <APPTECH.DIST>.
Some of them were previously on <HP-PSL>.  They are
PSL-USERS.
PSL-PROJECT.
PSL-NEWS.
The news distribution automatically includes all users.

Mail to PSL is automatically distributed according to <HP-PSL>PSL-BUGS.DIST.
This is not intended for general use as a distribution list, and
also is assumed by the mail transport system to be in <HP-PSL>,
so leave it there.  Anyone wishing to receive a copy of PSL bug
reports may put him/herself on the list.

Subject: PSL disk space on SS:
To: kennard
cc: PSL-Project: ;

It appears that SS: is ready to receive the PSL files, though Tim
has not sent me personally a message saying so.  Files will be
organized somewhat differently on SS: than they are now on PS:.
There will be no <HP-PSL> or any of its subdirectories.  There
will be <PSL> and subdirectories.  Please allocate it 50
subdirectories and 20,000 pages of space.  This family of
directories is intended to include space for Alan Snyder's PSL
editor, Nancy K's mailer program, and "Visicalc" files.

There will be a <PSL-DISTRIBUTION> directory to contain a
complete snapshot of PSL as distributed to other sites.  Please
allocate it 30 subdirectories and 8,000 pages.

We are requesting a system logical name definition for PSL (PSL:)
to be defined as SS:<PSL>, like PASCAL, SAIL, and other
subsystems have.

The mailer forwards mail to PSL through a distribution list file
currently defined to be <PSL>PSL-BUGS.DIST.  Please change this
forwarding to go through PSL:PSL-BUGS.DIST (assumes the existence
of the system logical name PSL:).

SYS:PSL.EXE currently causes <PSL>PSL.EXE to be executed.  Please
change SYS:PSL.EXE to execute PSL:PSL.EXE.  There is also a file
named SYS:NPSL.EXE.  Please replace it with a file that causes
PSL:NPSL.EXE to be run.
