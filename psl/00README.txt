In this directory you find two gzipped tar files with "old" PSL sources and binaries, 
i.e. for architectures that are only of historical interest, like s390, alpha, mips, i860 and many more.

pslold.tar.gz contains the sources and the bpsl binaries.
binpslold.tar.gz contains the image files for bare-psl and the psl compiler.

Together they allow you to run PSL on one of these systems.
