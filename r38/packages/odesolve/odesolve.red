switch odesolve_basis$                  % output basis as linear ODE solution
switch odesolve_noswap$                 % do not swap variables
switch odesolve_norecurse$              % no recursion => noswap
% The `noswap' and `norecurse' switches are mainly for debugging.
switch odesolve_fast$                   % no heuristics => norecurse
% The `fast' switch disables all non-deterministic solution techniques
% (including most of those for nonlinear ODEs of order > 1).  it is
% useful if ODESolve is used as a service routine, including calling
% it recursively in a hook.  It makes ODESolve 1+ behave like the
% odesolve distributed with REDUCE versions up to and including 3.7,
% and so does not affect the odesolve.tst file.

% to save resources if ODE solutions will not be further manipulated,
