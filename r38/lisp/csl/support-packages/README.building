The script
    build-all.sh
is intended to build FOX pretty well automatically.

Several special cases arise, and as a (possible) convenience I have
small helper scripts to cover them.  These are
   Building with debug options
   Building for Windows Xp (64-bit). This is EXPERIMENTAL.
   Building for Cygwin using the cygwin libraries. In this
      case any code that is built must not be propagated or
      distributed because of the GPL restrictions that
      Cygwin imposes.
