/*
 * This generator starts by using a 55/24 (or other) Lagged Fibonacci
 * generator, except that at each stage I sometimes use XOR, sometimes "+"
 * and sometimes "-". Each of these are much like simple XOR and specifically
 * do just that on the least significant bit (so we still have a period
 * of 2^k-1 there) but they make propagation into higher parts of the
 * word non-linear. I selected the mix of operators based on digits from
 * pi in the expectation that that leaves few systematic patterns.
 * The period of the whole register is clearly some multiple of (2^k-1).
 * It will not be 2^32 as big, but experiments with short registers
 * suggests that it will be an long enough, say over 2^16 times as long. If
 * I take k=65 then this ought to be sufficient.
 *
 * I collect a block of k words from that, and then form output words
 * by combining items from there in various shifted manners so that what
 * comes out mixes bits from high and low in the basic register with the
 * result that that knowledge of one output word does not reveal a single
 * clear value in the shift register. Again I use "^", "+" and "-" for
 * the combining and a manner mixed up using pi. The selection of which
 * of the registers words are combined is also derived from digits of pi
 * rather than being simply sequential. In particular the bottom bit of
 * an word in the shift register is only used after being XORed with a value
 * from 18 bits higher by where the perios ought to be long enough
 * and the mixing sufficient to obscure them. The high order bits (which
 * one might attack since they are used to control the shuffling) are mixed
 * with data from 13 bits lower, and also benefit (sometimes) from carries and
 * borrows in the combining.  In a sixty-four bit register a large number
 * of bits in the middle of the word get formed by combining bits of three
 * raw words. For 32-bit working it is roughly the case that the bottom
 * section of an output word comes from one pair (A,B) say while the top
 * comes from a different pair (A,C).
 *
 * Finally I shuffle in a N (= 4096 perhaps) entry buffer so that answers
 * do not get issued in (easily) predictable order.  Each cycling of the
 * generator produces k words in this manner, but I then only keep 32 of
 * these. Discarding the rest corresponds to throwing away a tolerably
 * confusing subset of the original shift-register output, as well as
 * arranging that output data is out of order.
 *
 * To start things I initially just fill the LFSR with data based upon
 * multiple copies of the key. I then cycle things. After a bit I
 * propagate information from the top half of each word to the bottom,
 * considering that without that the low order bits will not gain information
 * from enough of the key. I also force a low order bit to be "1" at
 * various stages (despite the bias!) to guarantee that my shift register
 * is not stuck in a zero cycle. I extract values form the generator to fill
 * up the shuffling buffer. Once crudely initialised I cycle the generator
 * enough times to refresh most of the values in the shuffle buffer several
 * times. This all makes key establishment pretty slow, but I view that
 * as almost desirable. It would of couse also be possible to fill both
 * shift register and buffer with values derived from the key using
 * a secure hash function.
 *
 * The arrangements here guarantee that the least significant bit of the
 * word-stream that is generated is of period 2^k-1. Each subsequent bit
 * counts as a further maximal-period shift register of length k that is
 * being driven by data injected via the carry chain from less significant
 * bits. I can not prove that there is no bias here, nor that the
 * resulting overall system has a period as long as one would hope for from
 * 32*k bits of state. One notes the analysis of the lagged-fibonacci
 * generator where Knuth reports on ways of distinguishing its output
 * from real randomness. These concerns are why I discard quite a large
 * proportion of the bits that I generate, and why I shuffle the output.
 *
 * We all know that shift-registers when used simply are weak. The
 * steps taken here to improve matters are
 * (a) using mixtures or +, - and ^ for the combining functions;
 * (b) shuffling the output, after the style of Knuth's "Algorithm B";
 * (c) discarding a proportion of the bits generated by the raw shift
 *     register;
 * (d) make each output depend on a combination of several words from
 *     the shift register, with not all words used.
 *
 * A lagged fibonacci generator would give more "1" bits than "0" in
 * various lengths of initial sub-sequence. I complement every other
 * output from the raw generator to mess this up a bit. The shuffling
 * then has to conceal whether I had odd or even items.
 *
 * Lagged fibonacci has trouble with a birthday spacings test, and shuffling
 * would not cure that, but throwing away some of my generated values will
 * help to a significant extent, as will the fact that I output words that
 * are generated as combinations of three items from the register.
 * A number of adjustments to the algorithm as shown here would be
 * obvious and easy to arrange:
 * (a) use a larger shuffle-buffer. At present I use 4096 words, but
 *     increasing it would hardly change the code and would tend to
 *     improve security but at the cost of memory requirement. Once
 *     can redefine a macro here to organise this;
 * (b) use SHA-1 or some other secure hash to initialise both the shift
 *     register and the shuffle buffer from the original key. This
 *     would probably be a good thing to do. I use the scheme itself here
 *     to make this code more self-contained;
 * (c) use a longer shift-register than the 55- or 65-entry one used here,
 *     but still only keep 32 words of output from each full cycle through
 *     it. That would slow things down in direct proportion to the
 *     length of the register, but would enhance security by making more
 *     information discarded as well as by increasing the period. The code
 *     here has a varienty of options that could be enabled;
 * (d) use 64-bit arithmetic but essentially unaltered code to get
 *     32 64-bit words out in the amount of time that this code yields
 *     32 32-bit words. The code makes provision for this;
 * (e) Base the design on a shift register with more taps, with a view
 *     that very few taps (as used here) are a source of weakness. Cost
 *     will grow proportional to the number of taps used.
 *
 * For (c) and (e) suitable tap positions so that the least significant bits
 * still have maximal cycle lengths would be needed.
 *
 * Performance (65/4096) at 32 bits is around
 *       1 millisecond to set up a new key
 *     100 Mbytes per second generation of guff
 *     (this is on a Pentium II at 400 Mhz)
 * and a crude test suggests that the scheme here fills a 128-byte buffer
 * roughly three times as fast as RC4 does (?).
