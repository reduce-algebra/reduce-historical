                              The CSL/REDUCE system
                              =====================



Systems Which are Supported or Known to work:
=============================================

  o Linux (gcc), x86, x86-64 (Opteron).
  o Windows XP, 2K, NT, Windows 9x, (MinGW)
  o Apple MAC OS-X.  You will need an X-Server, either Apple's or XFree.



For most UNIX systems.
======================

For most unix systems you can configure simply as:


        ./configure


After configure runs its course, simply type ``make'' to build the library,
and ``make install'' to install it.

Building for Debug or Release.
==============================

Normal builds [w/o any special arguments to configure] will include assert and
trace statements into the library, but no debug symbols.  This mode compiles
the fastest and allows for tracing. 

Building for debug will add debug symbols as needed by your debugger.  It also
includes assert and tracing into the library.  This setting is recommended if
you need to debug CSL itself.  Full debug executables are build by
configuring with:


        ./configure --enable-debug



Release builds strip all debug information, asserts, and tracing, and generates
optimized code.  The resulting library is the smallest/fastest, and this is the
recommended setting for production code.  To build for release, use:


        ./configure --enable-release
