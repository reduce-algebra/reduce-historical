The "distorm" Intel/AMD disassembler was written by Gil Dabah,
http://ragestorm.net/distorm/, and is released under the BSD license.

A full original archive is in support-packages/distorm-package.zip
and can also be fetched from the above web-site. The files from distorm
used here are listed here. To arrange that they can compile without
needing to be in a sub-directory and to avoid clashed with the
"autoconf" tools file-name "config.h" the distorm file config.h has
been renamed as diconfig.h and some #include statements have had
paths changed, but not changes to the bodies of any of these files have
been made.

The code is only relevant on Intel and AMD platforms and that is liable
to mean that I only need to compile them there, so that greatly reduces
any fuss about code portability that I could imagine.

Files:
   disconfig.h
   distorm.h
   diconfig.h    (was config.h)
   decoder.c
   decoder.h     (config.h -> diconfig.h)
   distorm.c
   instructions.c
   instructions.h
   insts.c
   insts.h
   operands.c    (config.h -> diconfig.h)
   operands.h
   prefix.c
   prefix.h
   textdefs.c
   textdefs.h    (config.h -> diconfig.h)
   wstring.c
   wstring.h     (config.h -> diconfig.h)
   x86defs.c
   x86defs.h

The following is the COPYING file from the distorm distribution, and it is
of course also present in the archive in the support-packages directory
(which is always distributed along with any binary of my own code).
