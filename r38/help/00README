ACN changes March 2004

mkhelp.bat deleted as being for German documentation only so not
of interest to Codemist

mkhelpw.bat adjusted so that I can use it again with r38 not r38, and
with hcp not hc (hc runs out of memory).  You need the Microsoft program
"hcp.exe" as a help compiler... but these days Microsoft would like
you to use "HTML Help Workshop" that generates help files in a format that
is Microsoft-only externsions to HTML...

===========================

To create HTML help I use the script "mkhtml1" which puts all of its
generated stuff in ../lisp/csl/r38.doc as about 10 medium-sized files.

I am ignoring all the other options that might be available and just
sticking with that.

This directory will not be distributed.
