ALGINT is an extension of the standard REDUCE integration package for the
integration of expressions involving square roots where the answer exists
in that class of functions.  It is an implementation of the work described
in [Davenport 1981].  Both this and the source code should be consulted for
a more detailed description of this work.

To use this package, the command

	LOAD ALGINT;

should be used.  The form of this command may vary according to
implementation.  One then enters an expression for integration, e.g.:

	INT(SQRT(X+SQRT(X**2+1)/X,X);

If one later wishes to integrate expressions without using the facilities of
this package, the switch ALGINT should be turned off. This is turned on
automatically when the package is loaded.

The switches supported by the standard integrator (e.g., TRINT) are also
supported by this package.  In addition, the switch TRA, if on, will give
further tracing information about the specific functioning of the algebraic
integrator.
