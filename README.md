### Historical Snapshot Archive

## Introduction

**REDUCE** is a freely available open-source interactive
system for general algebraic computations, of interest to
mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.

It can be used interactively for simple calculations, but
also provides a flexible and expressive user programming language.

----

## Historical Snapshots

This repository contains informal (and not-guaranteed-complete)
historical snapshots of some previous releases of Reduce.

## More Information

*There should not be any binaries or serious build scripts here,
and these are all to be viewed as* **OUT OF DATE** *and*
**NOT SUPPORTED AT ALL.**

However, some people may enjoy seeing how the code-base has grown,
and getting a bit of insight into the world of the past. Developers
tracking newly uncovered bugs may also find it useful to look back
into these archives in case that provides insight.

----

## Support

Please do not ask the **REDUCE** developers about building or
installing from these old files. All current support is focused
only on the main version.

----

## Licensing

The files here typically have old restrictive copyright notices, and
sometimes restrictive license terms. They are included here by virtue
of the permission that their originators granted to Anthony C. Hearn
and his distributors to use them.

**You should not modify and redistribute** ***anything*** from this
directory without _careful_ thought.
